# Viberesp Project-Specific Instructions

This file contains project-specific instructions for Claude Code when working on the viberesp codebase.

## Project Overview

Viberesp is a CLI tool for loudspeaker enclosure design and simulation, with initial focus on **horn-loaded enclosures**. The simulation engine implements acoustic theory from first principles and validates results against Hornresp (the industry-standard horn simulation tool).

**Key workflow:**
1. Import driver parameters (manual entry via CLI)
2. Explore enclosure types and variables
3. Export to Hornresp for validation
4. Iterate based on validation results

## CRITICAL: Literature Citation Requirements

### ALL Simulation Code MUST Cite Literature

**This is the most important rule in this project:**

Every function in the `src/viberesp/simulation/` module that implements acoustic theory **MUST** cite the literature it implements.

### Citation Format

Every simulation function must include:

1. **Docstring with literature citations** - Reference specific literature files and equation numbers
2. **Inline comments** - Link to specific equations from the literature
3. **Validation requirements** - State how the implementation will be validated against Hornresp

#### Example - Correct Citation Format

```python
def calculate_horn_cutoff(flare_constant: float, speed_of_sound: float = 343.0) -> float:
    """
    Calculate the cutoff frequency of an exponential horn.

    The cutoff frequency is the frequency below which the horn acts as a
    high-pass filter and does not efficiently propagate sound waves.

    Based on Olson (1947), Equation 5.18 and Beranek (1954), Chapter 5.
    Both sources derive the same expression from the horn equation.

    Literature:
    - literature/horns/olson_1947.md - Exponential horn theory, Eq. 5.12, 5.18
    - literature/horns/beranek_1954.md - Horn impedance, Chapter 5, Eq. 5.20
    - literature/horns/kolbrek_horn_theory_tutorial.md - Modern treatment with validation

    Args:
        flare_constant: Horn flare constant m (1/m), where S(x) = S_t · exp(m·x)
        speed_of_sound: Speed of sound in air (m/s), default 343 m/s at 20°C

    Returns:
        Cutoff frequency f_c (Hz), below which the horn does not propagate efficiently

    Validation:
        Compare with Hornresp's cutoff frequency calculation for identical
        flare constant. Expected agreement: <0.1% deviation.

    Examples:
        >>> calculate_horn_cutoff(flare_constant=4.6)
        250.0  # Hz (for m=4.6, c=343)
    """
    # Olson (1947), Eq. 5.18: f_c = c·m/(2π)
    # Beranek (1954), Chapter 5: Same expression derived from horn equation
    return (speed_of_sound * flare_constant) / (2 * math.pi)
```

### What Requires Citations

**MUST cite literature:**
- All acoustic impedance calculations
- Horn profile equations (exponential, hyperbolic, conical)
- Frequency response calculations
- Directivity patterns
- Throat/mouth impedance transformations
- Cutoff frequency formulas
- Efficiency calculations
- Power handling estimates

**Does NOT require citations:**
- CLI interface code (click commands, prompts)
- File I/O operations
- Data validation
- Testing infrastructure
- Plotting/visualization code
- Configuration management

### Code Review Criteria

When reviewing simulation code, check:

1. [ ] Does the function have a docstring?
2. [ ] Does the docstring include a "Literature:" section?
3. [ ] Are specific literature files referenced?
4. [ ] Are equation numbers cited (e.g., "Olson Eq. 5.18")?
5. [ ] Do inline comments reference the literature?
6. [ ] Is there a validation section describing how to verify against Hornresp?
7. [ ] Does the implementation match the cited equations?

**Pull requests without proper citations will be rejected.**

## Development Workflow

### Literature-First Development

When implementing a new simulation feature:

1. **Start with literature/** - Read the relevant reference files
2. **Identify the equations** - Find the specific equations to implement
3. **Write the docstring first** - Include full citations before coding
4. **Implement the equations** - Translate math to code
5. **Validate against Hornresp** - Create test cases comparing results
6. **Document any discrepancies** - Explain any deviations from reference

### Validation Against Hornresp

Every simulation algorithm must be validated against Hornresp:

1. Create test cases with known horn parameters
2. Run viberesp simulation
3. Run Hornresp with identical parameters
4. Compare results (impedance, frequency response, etc.)
5. Document agreement percentage
6. Investigate and explain any discrepancies >1%

Acceptable tolerances:
- Well above cutoff (f > 2·f_c): <1% deviation
- Near cutoff (f ≈ 1.2·f_c to 2·f_c): <2% deviation
- Close to cutoff (f ≈ f_c): <5% deviation (numerical sensitivity)
- Below cutoff (f < f_c): qualitative agreement only

### Exporting to Hornresp Format

Viberesp can export driver and enclosure parameters to Hornresp's native `.txt` file format for direct import and validation.

**Using the export function:**

```python
from viberesp.hornresp.export import export_to_hornresp
from viberesp.driver.bc_drivers import get_bc_15ps100

# Get driver
driver = get_bc_15ps100()

# Export ported box design
export_to_hornresp(
    driver=driver,
    driver_name="15PS100 Ported B4",
    output_path="15ps100_ported.txt",
    comment="B4 Butterworth alignment",
    enclosure_type="ported_box",
    Vb_liters=105.5,
    Fb_hz=37.3,
    port_area_cm2=140.2,
    port_length_cm=22.8
)
```

**Supported enclosure types:**
- `"infinite_baffle"` - No enclosure parameters needed
- `"sealed_box"` - Requires `Vb_liters` (box volume in liters)
- `"ported_box"` - Requires `Vb_liters`, `Fb_hz`, `port_area_cm2`, `port_length_cm`

**Critical differences between viberesp and Hornresp:**

1. **M_md vs M_ms**: Hornresp expects **M_md** (driver mass only, without radiation mass)
   - Viberesp exports `M_md` automatically via `driver_to_hornresp_record()`
   - Hornresp calculates its own radiation mass loading
   - **Never export M_ms** to Hornresp (would double-count radiation mass)

2. **Unit conversions** (handled automatically by export function):
   - Area: m² → cm² (multiply by 10000)
   - Mass: kg → g (multiply by 1000)
   - Inductance: H → mH (multiply by 1000)
   - Compliance: m/N (scientific notation format: X.XXE-XX)

3. **File format requirements**:
   - CRLF line endings (`\r\n`) - not Unix LF (`\n`)
   - Section headers with `|` prefix (e.g., `|TRADITIONAL DRIVER PARAMETER VALUES:`)
   - Cms in scientific notation with exactly 2 decimal places
   - All required sections must be present

4. **Chamber depth (Lrc)**: Auto-calculated if not provided
   - Must be > 0 for sealed/ported boxes (Hornresp requirement)
   - Calculated as cube root of Vb, clamped to physical constraints
   - Constraints: `2×piston_radius ≤ Lrc ≤ Vb/S_piston`

**Example: Exporting a complete design**

```python
# Calculate optimal design
from viberesp.enclosure.ported_box import (
    calculate_ported_box_system_parameters,
    calculate_optimal_port_dimensions
)

# Design parameters
Vb = driver.V_as  # Use Vas for B4 alignment
Fb = driver.F_s   # Use Fs for B4 alignment

# Get system parameters
params = calculate_ported_box_system_parameters(driver, Vb, Fb)
port_area_m2, port_length_m, _ = calculate_optimal_port_dimensions(driver, Vb, Fb)

# Export to Hornresp
export_to_hornresp(
    driver=driver,
    driver_name="15PS100_B4",
    output_path="designs/15ps100_b4.txt",
    comment="B4 Butterworth: Vb=Vas, Fb=Fs",
    enclosure_type="ported_box",
    Vb_liters=Vb * 1000,
    Fb_hz=Fb,
    port_area_cm2=port_area_m2 * 10000,
    port_length_cm=port_length_m * 100
)
```

**Validation workflow:**

1. Export design from viberesp
2. Import into Hornresp (File → Import)
3. Run simulations in both tools
4. Compare frequency responses, impedance curves
5. Document any discrepancies

**Literature:**
- Hornresp User Manual - File format specification
- `src/viberesp/hornresp/export.py` - Implementation with format details

## File Organization Guidelines

### CRITICAL: No Files in Top-Level Directory (TLD)

**DO NOT create files in the project root directory.** All files must be organized in appropriate subdirectories.

### Directory Structure for Documentation and Research

- Reference materials → `literature/{category}/`

**Code:**
- Source code → `src/viberesp/`
- Tests → `tests/`
- Examples → `examples/` (if it exists)

### What Belongs in TLD (Top-Level Directory)

**ONLY these files should be in the project root:**
- `CLAUDE.md` - Project-specific instructions (this file)
- `README.md` - Project overview and setup
- `ROADMAP.md` - Development roadmap
- `pyproject.toml` - Python project configuration
- `.gitignore` - Git ignore rules
- `LICENSE` - License file
- Standard config files (`.github/`, etc.)

**NOT in TLD:**
- ❌ Investigation notes (→ `tasks/` or `docs/validation/`)
- ❌ Research summaries (→ `tasks/` or `docs/validation/`)
- ❌ Status reports (→ `tasks/`)
- ❌ Temporary analysis scripts (→ `tasks/`)
- ❌ Test data (→ `tests/`)

### Tracked vs Untracked Files

**Git Tracked (project files):**
- All documentation in `docs/`
- Active tasks in `tasks/`
- Test data in `tests/`
- Source code in `src/`
- Literature reference files in `literature/`

**Git Untracked (personal/temporary):**
- Python cache in `/tmp/` or `/private/tmp/`
- Session summaries in `/tmp/`
- Personal notes outside project tree
- Build artifacts (handled by `.gitignore`)
- Virtual environments (`.venv/`)

**When to commit:**
- Investigation results → Yes (to `docs/` or `tasks/`)
- Completed research → Yes (to `docs/validation/`)
- Working scripts → Yes (to `tasks/`)
- `/tmp/` files → No (temporary workspace)

### Examples

**✅ CORRECT:**
```bash
# Create investigation report in docs/
docs/validation/sealed_box_spl_investigation.md

# Create active research plan in tasks/
tasks/research_validation_plan.md

# Create temporary script for debugging
tasks/diagnose_spl_rolloff.py
```

**❌ WRONG:**
```bash
# DON'T create in TLD
sealed_box_investigation.md  # Wrong! → docs/validation/
research_plan.md             # Wrong! → tasks/
debug_script.py              # Wrong! → tasks/
```

## Code Structure Conventions

### Directory Organization

```
src/viberesp/
├── cli.py                   # CLI entry point (click commands)
├── driver/                  # Driver parameter handling
│   └── parameters.py        # Thiele-Small parameter data structures
├── simulation/              # SIMULATION CODE MUST CITE LITERATURE

└── validation/              # Validation framework
    └── compare.py           # Compare viberesp vs Hornresp results
```

### Import Conventions

- Use absolute imports: `from viberesp.simulation import horn_theory`
- Keep simulation modules independent of CLI code
- Validation code should import both simulation and hornresp modules

### Naming Conventions

- Functions: `snake_case`
- Classes: `PascalCase`
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- Module names: `snake_case`

For physics functions, use descriptive names:
- `calculate_horn_impedance()` (not `calc_z()`)
- `exponential_horn_area()` (not `exp_area()`)
- `cutoff_frequency()` (not `fc()`)

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests

All simulation functions must have unit tests:

```python
def test_calculate_horn_cutoff():
    """Test cutoff frequency calculation against Olson Eq. 5.18"""
    # Test case from Olson (1947), Section 5.6
    m = 4.6  # flare constant (1/m)
    c = 343.0  # speed of sound (m/s)
    fc_expected = 250.0  # Hz

    fc_calculated = calculate_horn_cutoff(m, c)

    assert abs(fc_calculated - fc_expected) < 0.1  # <0.1% tolerance
```

### Validation Tests

Create validation tests comparing with Hornresp:

```python
def test_exponential_horn_vs_hornresp():
    """Validate exponential horn impedance against Hornresp"""
    # Define horn parameters
    horn_params = ExponentialHorn(
        throat_area=0.001,  # m²
        mouth_area=0.1,     # m²
        length=1.5,         # m
    )

    # Calculate impedance with viberesp
    z_viberesp = calculate_throat_impedance(horn_params, frequency=500)

    # Load Hornresp reference data
    z_hornresp = load_hornresp_reference("test_data/exp_horn_001.csv")

    # Compare
    assert abs(z_viberesp - z_hornresp) / z_hornresp < 0.01  # <1% deviation
```

### Test Data Organization

Store Hornresp reference data in `tests/validation_data/`:

```
tests/validation_data/
├── exponential_horns/
│   ├── exp_horn_001.csv     # Frequency, impedance, phase from Hornresp
│   ├── exp_horn_002.csv
│   └── ...
└── hyperbolic_horns/
    └── ...
```

## Documentation Standards

### Docstring Format

Use Google-style docstrings with extensions:

```python
def function_name(param1: type, param2: type) -> return_type:
    """
    Brief description of what the function does.

    Longer description explaining the physics and theory if needed.
    Mention any assumptions or limitations.

    Based on Author (Year), Equation X.Y and possibly other sources.

    Literature:
    - literature/path/to/reference1.md - Description of what's used
    - literature/path/to/reference2.md - Additional relevant info

    Args:
        param1: Description with units (e.g., meters, Hz)
        param2: Description with units

    Returns:
        Description of return value with units

    Raises:
        ValueError: Description of when error occurs

    Validation:
        How to validate against Hornresp, expected tolerance

    Examples:
        >>> function_name(1.0, 2.0)
        42.0
    """
```

### Physical Constants

Define constants with citations:

```python
# Standard conditions at 20°C, 1 atm
# From Kinsler et al. (1982), Chapter 1
SPEED_OF_SOUND = 343.0  # m/s
AIR_DENSITY = 1.18  # kg/m³
```

## Optimization and Exploration

### Future Features (Roadmap Phases 6-7)

When implementing optimization and parameter exploration:

1. Maintain citation requirements for all simulation code
2. Optimization algorithms (pymoo) don't need citations, but objective functions do
3. Document which literature provides the optimization criteria (e.g., "maximize efficiency at 80 Hz per Beranek Chapter 8")

### Parameter Sweep Conventions

When exploring parameter space:

- Store results with full parameter metadata
- Include literature citations for each calculation
- Validate spot checks against Hornresp
- Warn if parameters violate assumptions from literature (e.g., horn too short for cutoff frequency)

## Common Pitfalls

### Units

**Always include units in documentation and variable names:**
- `area_m2` not `area`
- `length_m` not `length`
- `frequency_hz` not `frequency`

### Reference Frame

Clarify coordinate system:
- `x = 0` at throat or mouth? (Convention: x=0 at throat)
- Positive x direction toward mouth

### Frequency Range

Document valid frequency ranges:
- Exponential horn theory valid for f > f_c
- Below cutoff, results are qualitative (evanescent waves)
- Very high frequencies may need directivity corrections

### Finite vs Infinite Horns

Be explicit about which model you're implementing:
- Infinite horn: Olson (1947) analytical solutions
- Finite horn: Beranek (1954) with mouth corrections, Kinsler (1982) transmission line approach

### M_md vs M_ms: Driver Mass Parameters

**CRITICAL**: Understand the distinction between driver mass parameters:

- **M_md** (Driver Mass): Physical mass of voice coil + diaphragm only (kg)
  - This is what you specify when creating a driver
  - Sourced from datasheet as "Mmd" or "Mms" (note: datasheet naming is inconsistent)
  - Does NOT include radiation mass loading

- **M_ms** (Total Moving Mass): M_md + radiation mass (kg)
  - This is calculated automatically in `ThieleSmallParameters.__post_init__()`
  - Includes frequency-dependent radiation mass from the air load
  - Used for resonance frequency and Q factor calculations

**Why this matters:**
Radiation mass loading significantly affects resonance frequency:
```
F_s = 1 / (2π√(M_ms·C_ms))

where M_ms = M_md + 2×M_rad(F_s)
```

The 2× multiplier on radiation mass matches Hornresp's empirical methodology
(see `src/viberesp/driver/radiation_mass.py` for implementation).

**Example: BC_8NDL51**
- M_md = 26.77 g (driver mass only, from datasheet)
- M_rad ≈ 3.7 g (radiation mass at resonance, from Beranek theory)
- M_ms ≈ 30.5 g (total mass = 26.77 + 2×3.7)
- Resonance shift: 68.3 Hz (driver only) → 64.0 Hz (with radiation) = 6.7% lower

**Literature:**
- Beranek (1954), Eq. 5.20 - Radiation impedance and mass loading
- `literature/horns/beranek_1954.md`
- `src/viberesp/driver/radiation_mass.py` - Implementation with iterative solver

## When in Doubt

1. **Read the literature** - Check `literature/horns/` for relevant equations
2. **Cite your sources** - Even if uncertain, cite the literature you're using
3. **Validate against Hornresp** - When viberesp and Hornresp disagree, investigate why
4. **Ask for clarification** - It's better to ask than to implement without citations

## Using an Online Research Agent

For difficult questions requiring external research, you can delegate to an online research agent. This is particularly useful for:
- Complex acoustic theory not in the existing literature
- Finding alternative approaches or implementations
- Researching specific libraries, frameworks, or tools
- Investigating edge cases or advanced topics

### When to Use a Research Agent

**Good candidates:**
- "How does pymoo handle constrained optimization for acoustic parameters?"
- "Find modern approaches to calculating horn throat impedance"
- "What are the best practices for validating physics simulations?"
- "Research numerical methods for solving transmission line equations"

**Not suitable for:**
- Questions about local code structure (use Explore agent instead)
- Simple documentation lookups (use Context7 instead)
- File searching or code navigation (use Glob/Grep instead)

### Research Agent Workflow

**Important:** The online research agent **does NOT have access to the local codebase**, but it **CAN access the public GitHub repository** at:
```
https://github.com/wokhouse/viberesp
```

When delegating to the research agent, provide relevant context or reference specific files/paths in the repo.

**Step 1: Prepare the research prompt**

Use the following template to generate a prompt for the research agent:

```
RESEARCH OBJECTIVE:
[Clearly state what you need to find out]

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
[What would a successful answer look like? What specific information do you need?]

CONTEXT:
[Briefly explain the viberesp project context - it's a horn simulation tool, validates against Hornresp, etc.]

RELEVANT CODE/DETAILS:
[Paste relevant code snippets, function signatures, or error messages here]

CONSTRAINTS:
- Focus on Python-based solutions
- Prefer approaches with citations to acoustic literature
- Numerical accuracy is critical (validated against Hornresp)
- Avoid over-engineering - keep solutions minimal

DELIVERABLE:
[Specifically what you want the agent to provide: explanation, code example, references, etc.]
```

**Step 2: Generate and copy the prompt**

Generate a well-structured prompt following the template above and use `pbcopy` to copy it for the user:

```bash
echo "YOUR_RESEARCH_PROMPT_HERE" | pbcopy
```

**Step 3: Inform the user**

Tell the user the prompt has been copied and instruct them to paste it to the online research agent.

### Example Research Prompt

Here's an example for researching numerical optimization:

```
RESEARCH OBJECTIVE:
Find the best approach for optimizing horn parameters (flare constant, length, mouth area) to maximize efficiency at a target frequency range.

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- Recommend a Python library for constrained optimization
- Provide code example showing how to set up the optimization problem
- Explain how to handle constraints (e.g., minimum horn length, maximum mouth size)
- Reference any acoustic literature on horn optimization

CONTEXT:
Viberesp is a Python CLI tool for horn-loaded enclosure design. It calculates horn impedance and frequency response from first principles, validated against Hornresp. We're adding optimization capabilities to help users find optimal horn parameters.

RELEVANT CODE/DETAILS:
We have these functions already implemented:
- `calculate_horn_efficiency(flare_constant, length, mouth_area, frequency)` -> returns efficiency (0-1)
- `calculate_horn_cutoff(flare_constant)` -> returns cutoff frequency (Hz)
- Driver Thiele-Small parameters available via `driver.F_s`, `driver.V_as`, etc.

Target frequency range: 40-80 Hz (bass horn)

CONSTRAINTS:
- Must use Python libraries (preferably already common in scientific computing)
- Solution must be numerically accurate - this drives physical horn designs
- Need to handle both continuous and discrete parameters
- Should provide convergence diagnostics

DELIVERABLE:
1. Recommended library with rationale
2. Code example showing objective function and constraint setup
3. Explanation of how to validate the optimization results
4. Any acoustic literature references on horn parameter optimization
```

### After Research

When the research agent provides results:
1. **Evaluate the solution** - Check if it meets the success criteria
2. **Verify citations** - Ensure any literature references are accurate
3. **Test locally** - Create a minimal test case before full implementation
4. **Document** - Add proper citations to CLAUDE.md or function docstrings
5. **Integrate** - Implement following the project's coding conventions

### Research Agent Output Format

The research agent should provide:
- **Direct answer** to your question
- **Code examples** (if applicable)
- **References** to literature or documentation
- **Recommendations** with rationale
- **Caveats or limitations** of the suggested approach

### Research Agent Response Format for Implementation Tasks

**IMPORTANT:** When delegating implementation research tasks, instruct the research agent to structure their response in two sections:

1. **Section 1: Research Findings** (for human review)
   - Theory explanation
   - Equations and derivations
   - Literature citations
   - Implementation notes and caveats

2. **Section 2: Implementation Instructions** (for Claude Code)
   - Write as a direct task specification for a future Claude Code instance
   - Include exact file paths and line numbers where possible
   - Provide complete code snippets ready to copy-paste
   - Specify validation steps and expected results

Template for implementation tasks:
```
IMPORTANT - RESPONSE FORMAT:
You are writing to BOTH (1) human researchers AND (2) a future Claude Code instance.
Structure your response with two sections:

## SECTION 1: RESEARCH FINDINGS (for human review)
- Theory explanation
- Equations and derivations
- Literature citations
- Implementation notes

## SECTION 2: IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS (for Claude Code)
Write this as a direct task specification for Claude Code, including:
- Files to modify (with exact paths)
- Implementation steps (with line numbers)
- Code changes (complete, ready to apply)
- Validation approach
- Expected results
```

This ensures the research agent's output can be directly used by Claude Code to implement the findings without needing additional interpretation.
