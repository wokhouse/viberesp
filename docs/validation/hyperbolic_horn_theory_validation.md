**Date:** 2025-12-30
**Status:** ✅ **VALIDATED**
**Reviewer:** Research Agent (Acoustic Literature Review)

## Executive Summary

The HyperbolicHorn implementation in viberesp has been validated against established acoustic theory. All key components (profile equation, T-matrix formulation, cutoff handling, and optimization strategy) are theoretically sound and match the literature.

**Validation Result:** The implementation is mathematically correct and ready for production use.

## 1. Profile Equation Validation

### Implementation
```python
S(x) = S_throat * [cosh(mx) + T*sinh(mx)]²
```

### Assessment: ✅ CORRECT

### Theoretical Basis
- **Source:** Salmon (1946), "A New Family of Horns"
- **Definition:** The hyperbolic family is based on the expansion of the *linear* dimension (radius):
  ```
  r(x) = r₀ * [cosh(mx) + T*sinh(mx)]
  ```
- **Area Profile:** Squaring the radius gives the area function S(x) as implemented

### Flare Constant (m)
**Question:** Should m be amplitude flare or intensity flare?

**Answer:** It must be the **Amplitude Flare Constant**

**Verification:**
```python
target_ratio = sqrt(S_mouth / S_throat)  # Operating in amplitude domain
```

By taking the square root of the area ratio, the implementation correctly operates in the linear amplitude domain. Therefore, the solved m is the amplitude flare constant.

## 2. T-Matrix Formulation Validation

### Implementation
```python
mu = sqrt(k² - m²)  # Effective wavenumber
A = (r_in/r_out) * (cos(mu*L) - grad_in * sinc_mu_L)
B = (1j * k * rho*c / sqrt(S_in*S_out)) * sinc_mu_L
D = (r_out/r_in) * (cos(mu*L) + grad_out * sinc_mu_L)
C = (A*D - 1) / B  # Reciprocity
```

### Assessment: ✅ CORRECT (Exact Analytic Solution)

### Theoretical Basis - "The Magic of Hypex"

**Webster's Horn Equation:**
```
ψ'' + (k² - r''/r)ψ = 0
```

**For Hyperbolic Profile:**
- Profile: r(x) = cosh(mx) + T·sinh(mx)
- Second derivative: r''(x) = m²[cosh(mx) + T·sinh(mx)] = m²·r(x)
- Curvature term: r''/r = m² (constant!)

**Wave Equation Simplification:**
```
ψ'' + (k² - m²)ψ = 0
```

This confirms that the use of a constant adjusted wavenumber `mu` for the entire segment is **not an approximation**—it is the **exact analytic solution** for the Hyperbolic profile.

### Below-Cutoff Handling
**Implementation:**
```python
if discriminant >= 0:
    mu = sqrt(k² - m²)  # Real (propagating)
    cos_mu_L = cos(mu*L)
    sin_mu_L = sin(mu*L)
else:
    mu = sqrt(m² - k²)  # Real value
    cos_mu_L = cosh(mu*L)
    sin_mu_L = 1j*sinh(mu*L)  # Imaginary (evanescent)
```

**Assessment:** ✅ CORRECT

This properly models evanescent wave propagation (reactive impedance) below the horn's cutoff frequency.

## 3. Gradient Calculations (grad_in, grad_out)

### Implementation
```python
def flare_grad(x_loc):
    h = cosh(m*x_loc) + T*sinh(m*x_loc)
    h_prime = m * (sinh(m*x_loc) + T*cosh(m*x_loc))
    return h_prime / h

grad_in = flare_grad(0)   # At throat
grad_out = flare_grad(L)  # At mouth
```

### Analytical Verification

**At Throat (x=0):**
- h(0) = cosh(0) + T·sinh(0) = 1 + 0 = 1
- h'(0) = m[sinh(0) + T·cosh(0)] = m[0 + T·1] = **m·T**
- **grad_in = h'(0)/h(0) = m·T** ✅

**At Mouth (x=L):**
- h(L) = cosh(mL) + T·sinh(mL)
- h'(L) = m[sinh(mL) + T·cosh(mL)]
- **grad_out = h'(L)/h(L) = [m(sinh(mL) + T·cosh(mL))] / [cosh(mL) + T·sinh(mL)]** ✅

### Assessment: ✅ CORRECT

The gradient calculations match the analytical formulas exactly.

## 4. T-Parameter Optimization Results

### Implementation Findings
```
Best Design:
  T1 = 0.84 (Segment 1: throat → middle)
  T2 = 0.73 (Segment 2: middle → mouth)

Response Flatness: 4.30 dB
Impedance Smoothness: 2.33
```

### Assessment: ✅ AGREES WITH LITERATURE

### Literature Consensus

| T Value | Profile | Characteristics |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| **T = 1.0** | Exponential | Smooth impedance rolloff, good transient response, reduced LF loading |
| **T < 0.5** | Catenoidal | Massive reactance peaks, difficult loading despite high resistance |
| **0.5 < T < 1** | Hypex | Extended bass with acceptable impedance ripple |

**Sources:**
- **Kolbrek (2008):** Notes that 0.5 < T < 1 is the most useful range for loading
- **Keele (1970s):** Suggested T = 0.707 as optimal compromise between LF output and flat group delay
- **Our Results:** T ≈ 0.7-0.85 discovered by NSGA-II optimizer ✅

**Conclusion:** The optimizer correctly balances bass extension against impedance ripple, finding the theoretical "sweet spot."

## Appendix: Mathematical Derivation

### Why the Effective Wavenumber is Exact

Starting from Webster's horn equation for pressure p:
```
∇²p + k²p = 0
```

For axisymmetric horns with profile r(x):
```
p'' + (2/r')p' + k²p = 0
```

Using the substitution ψ = r·p:
```
ψ'' + (k² - r''/r)ψ = 0
```

For the Hyperbolic profile:
```
r(x) = cosh(mx) + T·sinh(mx)
r''(x) = m²[cosh(mx) + T·sinh(mx)] = m²·r(x)
```

Therefore:
```
r''/r = m² (constant!)
```

And the wave equation becomes:
```
ψ'' + (k² - m²)ψ = 0
```

This is a **simple harmonic oscillator** with effective wavenumber:
```
μ = √(k² - m²)
```

The solution is exact because the curvature term is constant for this profile family.
