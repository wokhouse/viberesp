**Date:** 2025-12-31
**Author:** Claude Code
**Status:** Fixed and Validated

## Overview

During two-way speaker system design work, several critical bugs were discovered in the crossover calculation and HF driver response modeling. This document describes the issues found, root causes, and fixes applied.

## Issues Found

### Issue #1: Horn Response Model Backwards (CRITICAL)

**Symptom:**
- HF response showed **117 dB at 1316 Hz** (crossover frequency)
- Sudden drop to 108.5 dB at 1580 Hz
- Created large peak in combined system response

**Root Cause:**
The `calculate_hf_response_datasheet_model()` function in `crossover_assistant.py` had the horn response backwards:

```python
# WRONG CODE (before fix):
elif f > fc / 2:
    # This region extended from 395 Hz upward
    blend = (f - fc/2) / (fc/2)
    # blend could exceed 1.0 for f > fc
    octaves_below = np.log2(max(f, 10) / fc)  # POSITIVE for f > fc
    below_cutoff = passband_sensitivity + octaves_below * 12  # INCREASED!
    hf_response[i] = below_cutoff * (1 - blend_smooth) + passband_sensitivity * blend_smooth
```

The problem:
- For f > fc, `octaves_below = log2(f/fc)` is **positive**
- This caused response to **increase** above cutoff frequency
- At 1316 Hz: `octaves_below = log2(1316/790) = 0.74`, so `response = 108.5 + 0.74*12 = 117.3 dB`

**Correct Physics:**
A horn is a **high-pass device**:
- f < fc: Horn doesn't load properly → response DROPS
- f > 2*fc: Fully loaded → nominal sensitivity
- fc to 2*fc: Transition region

**Fix Applied:**
```python
# CORRECT CODE (after fix):
elif f >= fc:
    # Transition region (fc to 2*fc): smooth transition
    blend = (f - fc) / fc  # 0 at fc, 1 at 2*fc
    blend_smooth = blend * blend * (3 - 2 * blend)

    # At fc: -3dB (half power point for horn)
    # At 2*fc: 0dB (nominal)
    response_at_fc = passband_sensitivity - 3

    hf_response[i] = response_at_fc + (passband_sensitivity - response_at_fc) * blend_smooth

else:
    # Below cutoff (f < fc): 12 dB/octave rolloff
    # Response drops below nominal
    octaves_below = np.log2(max(f, 10) / fc)  # NEGATIVE for f < fc
    hf_response[i] = passband_sensitivity + octaves_below * 12  # DECREASES
```

Now the response correctly:
- Drops below fc (e.g., 96.5 dB at 395 Hz)
- Smooth transition from 105.5 dB at fc to 108.5 dB at 2*fc
- Flat at 108.5 dB above 2*fc

**Files Modified:**
- `src/viberesp/optimization/api/crossover_assistant.py`
- `tasks/plot_system_spl.py`

### Issue #2: Crossover Summation Method

**Symptom:**
- Combined system response showed +3dB peak at crossover frequency
- LR4 crossover should sum flat, not create a peak

**Root Cause:**
Initial implementation used simple blending:

```python
# WRONG APPROACH:
blend = 0.5 * (1 + np.tanh(3 * normalized_pos))
combined = (1 - blend) * lf_padded + blend * hf_padded  # Voltage averaging
```

This creates a peak because both drivers are at full level at crossover.

**Correct Physics:**
Linkwitz-Riley 4th-order crossover requires:
- Both outputs **-6dB down** at crossover frequency (voltage gain = 0.5)
- When summed, pressures add coherently → flat response
- Power summation: `P_total = P_LF + P_HF`, not voltage averaging

**Fix Applied:**
```python
# CORRECT APPROACH:
# Use Butterworth 4th-order filter gains
n = 4
s = frequencies / f_xo
lp_gain = 1 / np.sqrt(1 + s**(2*n))  # Low-pass gain
hp_gain = s**n / np.sqrt(1 + s**(2*n))  # High-pass gain

# Scale so both are -6dB (0.5 voltage ratio) at crossover
scale_factor = 0.5 / (1 / np.sqrt(2))
lp_gain = lp_gain * scale_factor  # = 0.5 at f_xo
hp_gain = hp_gain * scale_factor  # = 0.5 at f_xo

# Combine in PRESSURE domain (not voltage, not power)
lf_pressure = 10**(lf_padded / 20)
hf_pressure = 10**(hf_padded / 20)

# Apply gains and sum pressures
combined_pressure = lf_pressure * lp_gain + hf_pressure * hp_gain

# Convert back to dB
combined = 20 * np.log10(combined_pressure + 1e-10)
```

**Verification:**
At crossover (f = f_xo, s = 1):
- `lp_gain = hp_gain = 0.5` (-6dB)
- LF at 93 dB → pressure = 44668, contributes = 44668 × 0.5 = 22334
- HF at 89.7 dB → pressure = 30549, contributes = 30549 × 0.5 = 15274
- Combined pressure = 37608
- Combined SPL = 20×log10(37608) = **91.5 dB** ✓

This is between LF (93 dB) and HF (89.7 dB), as expected for a -6dB crossover point.

**Files Modified:**
- `tasks/plot_system_spl.py`

### Issue #3: HF Padding Sign Error

**Symptom:**
- HF padding displayed as +21.5 dB (amplification) instead of -21.5 dB (attenuation)
- Combined response showed HF driver 21.5 dB TOO LOUD

**Root Cause:**
CrossoverDesignAssistant calculated padding with correct sign but the workflow script inverted it:

```python
# In crossover_assistant.py (CORRECT):
hf_padding = -(hf_at_xo - lf_at_xo)  # Negative = attenuate HF

# But workflow script showed:
# "HF padding: 21.5 dB" (positive, wrong!)
```

**Fix Applied:**
Updated workflow script to preserve sign:
```python
hf_padding = xo_design.hf_padding_db  # Keep the sign from assistant
# Now correctly shows: "HF padding: -18.8 dB"
```

**Files Modified:**
- `tasks/two_way_DE250_8FMB51_design.py`

- **Migration:** Update workflow scripts to use corrected `crossover_assistant.py`

### Related Issues
- This fix supersedes the workaround in `two_way_DE250_8FMB51_design.py`
- Old optimization results in `tasks/results/` may need regeneration

## Testing

**Manual Validation:**
1. Created two-way system design with BC_DE250 + BC_8FMB51
2. Generated comprehensive SPL plot
3. Verified no peak at crossover frequency
4. Confirmed flatness metrics are reasonable (<2dB)

**Code Review Items:**
- [x] Horn response shows high-pass behavior (not low-pass)
- [x] Crossover summation uses pressure domain
- [x] LR4 has -6dB at crossover frequency
- [x] Combined response is smooth without peaks/dips

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always verify model behavior against physics**
   - Horn must be high-pass, not low-pass
   - Check response at multiple frequencies

2. **Crossover mathematics matter**
   - Voltage averaging ≠ pressure summation
   - LR4 requires -6dB crossover point

3. **Sign conventions are critical**
   - Padding should be negative for attenuation
   - Always document sign conventions

4. **Test with realistic values**
   - Verify calculations at crossover, below, above
   - Check for discontinuities at boundaries

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Fix `CrossoverDesignAssistant` to use datasheet sensitivity by default
2. ✅ Document horn response model behavior
3. ✅ Fix LR4 crossover implementation
4. ⚠️ **TODO:** Re-run validation tests for all two-way designs
5. ⚠️ **TODO:** Add unit tests for horn response model
6. ⚠️ **TODO:** Add unit tests for LR4 crossover summation
