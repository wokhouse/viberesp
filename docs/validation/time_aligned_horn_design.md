# Time-Aligned Horn-Loaded Loudspeaker Design

**Date:** 2025-12-30
**Status:** Validated with LR4 crossover simulation
**Authors:** Viberesp Project

## Executive Summary

Horn-loaded loudspeakers require physical time alignment to achieve flat frequency response at the crossover point. This document presents validated design principles for time-aligned two-way horn systems, with specific cabinet dimensions for a BC_10NW64 + BC_DE250 system.

**Key Finding:** For deep horns (>0.5m), extending the horn forward (protruding design) is superior to recessing the LF driver for both construction simplicity and aesthetics.

## The Physics Problem

### Z-Offset Phase Cancellation

When HF and LF drivers have different acoustic center positions, the time delay creates phase cancellation at crossover:

```
Delay (seconds) = Z_offset (meters) / Speed_of_sound (m/s)
Phase shift (degrees) = -360 × Frequency (Hz) × Delay (s)
```

**For our system:**
- Horn depth: 0.76 m
- Speed of sound: 343 m/s
- Delay: 2.2 ms
- Crossover at 800 Hz: **-632° phase shift = destructive interference**

**Result:** 6.25 dB dip at crossover frequency when using LR4 filters.

### Why LR4 is Sensitive to Phase

LR4 (Linkwitz-Riley 4th-order) crossovers sum flat only when drivers are **in phase** at crossover. Phase mismatch causes:
- Destructive interference at crossover
- Uneven frequency response
- Poor imaging and transient response

---

## Solution: Physical Time Alignment

Align the acoustic centers of both drivers in the same plane (typically the front baffle).

### Option Comparison

| Option | Construction | Aesthetics | Practicality | Recommendation |
|--------|-------------|------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Recess LF Driver** | Complex (internal tunnel) | Clean | Difficult access, sealing issues | ❌ Not recommended |
| **Extend Horn Forward** | Simple (standard baffle) | Distinctive, purposeful | Easy driver access | ✅ **Recommended** |
| **DSP Delay** | N/A (electronic) | Clean | Requires active system | ✅ If building active |

### Why Protruding Horn is Best

**Construction:**
- Flat front baffle (easy to cut and mount)
- Both drivers accessible from front
- Standard ported box construction
- No internal tunnels or complex chambers
- Simple, proven approach

**Aesthetics:**
- Proclaims "this is a horn system"
- Classic audio heritage (Altec, JBL, Western Electric)
- Visual interest and conversation piece
- Professional appearance

**Validation:**
- Used in legendary speakers (Altec A7, JBL Hartsfield)
- Industry standard for PA and studio monitors
- Time-tested design approach

## General Design Principles for Time-Aligned Horn Systems

### 1. Calculate Required Time Alignment

```python
# Determine Z-offset from horn design
horn_length = calculate_horn_length(expansion_ratio, mouth_area, throat_area)

# Calculate delay
delay_seconds = horn_length / speed_of_sound  # 343 m/s

# Phase shift at crossover
phase_shift_degrees = -360 * crossover_frequency * delay_seconds
```

### 2. Physical Alignment Options

**Option A: Protruding Horn (Recommended for depth > 0.5m)**
```
Horn extends forward by: Z_offset = horn_length
LF driver mounted on: Front baffle
Result: Acoustic centers aligned at baffle plane
```

**Option B: Recessed LF Driver (Alternative)**
```
LF driver mounted: Z_offset behind front baffle
Horn mounted: Flush with front baffle
Result: Acoustic centers aligned at baffle plane
```

**Option C: DSP Alignment (Active Systems)**
```
Apply electronic delay: delay_seconds to LF driver
No physical modifications needed
Requires: Active crossover with DSP
```

### 3. Crossover Design Considerations

**LR4 Crossover Requirements:**
- Drivers must be in phase at crossover frequency
- Time alignment critical for flat summation
- HF padding typically required (sensitivity mismatch)

**Crossover Frequency Selection:**
- Above HF horn cutoff (Fc × 1.5 minimum)
- Below LF beaming frequency (< 1 kHz for 10" driver)
- Consider driver overlap region (1-2 octaves)

**Sensitivity Matching:**
- Calculate HF padding: `Padding_dB = LF_passband_dB - HF_passband_dB`
- Implement with L-pad or resistor network (passive)
- Or adjust in DSP (active)

### 4. Horn Design Guidelines

**Mouth Size:**
- Minimum for directivity control down to Fc:
  ```
  Mouth_circumference ≥ Wavelength_at_Fc
  Mouth_diameter ≥ Speed_of_sound / (π × Fc)
  ```

- For Fc = 480 Hz:
  ```
  Mouth_diameter ≥ 343 / (π × 480) = 227 mm
  Design uses 356 mm (better directivity control)
  ```

**Flare Profile:**
- Exponential: Simple, predictable directivity
- Hyperbolic: Slightly better loading (requires optimization)
- Conical: Wide dispersion but poor loading

**Throat Considerations:**
- Throat chamber volume affects HF response
- Phase plug design critical for HF extension
- Compression ratio (Sd / S_throat) typically 10:1 to 50:1

### 5. LF Enclosure Integration

**Volume Calculations:**
- Driver displacement: Include in Vb calculations
- Horn volume: NOT part of Vb (external)
- Port volume: Subtract from net volume
- Bracing/damping: Subtract ~10% for displacement

**Baffle Effects:**
- Large baffle extends LF response
- Baffle step correction may be needed (~6 dB rise below 200-300 Hz)
- Can be addressed in crossover or with electrical contour

## Validation and Testing

### Simulation Validation

The LR4 crossover simulation (`src/viberesp/crossover/lr4.py`) has been validated:

**Test Setup:**
- LF: BC_10NW64 in 26.5L ported box @ 70 Hz
- HF: BC_DE250 on exponential horn (Fc=480 Hz, L=0.76m)
- Crossover: LR4 @ 800 Hz
- Alignment: Horn protrudes 0.76m (Z-offset = 0)

**Results:**
- Filter slope: 24.76 dB/octave ✅ (expected ~24 dB)
- No crossover dip with Z-offset = 0 ✅
- System F3: ~65 Hz ✅
- Flatness (100-10000 Hz): σ = 2.27 dB ✅

**Comparison (with vs without time alignment):**
```
At 800 Hz crossover:
- Z-offset = 0.76m (misaligned): 83.78 dB + 6.25 dB dip
- Z-offset = 0m (aligned):      90.04 dB (flat)
```

### Physical Validation

**Recommended tests:**
1. **Impulse response** - Verify aligned wavefronts
2. **Polar response** - Check directivity at crossover
3. **Harmonic distortion** - Measure at crossover
4. **Impedance** - Verify no interaction issues

**Measurement setup:**
- Ground plane measurement (preferred for LF)
- Nearfield measurement (for validation)
- Anechoic or gated measurement (for HF)

## Alternative Designs

### Active System with DSP

If building an active system, you can use DSP for time alignment:

**Benefits:**
- No physical alignment required
- Precise control (sample-level accuracy)
- Can implement advanced crossovers (linear phase, etc.)

**Implementation:**
```python
# Apply 2.2ms delay to LF driver
lf_delayed = delay_signal(lf_samples, delay_samples=106)  # 2.2ms @ 48kHz

# Then apply LR4 crossover
combined = lr4_crossover(lf_delayed, hf, crossover_freq=800)
```

### Multiple Driver Arrays

For larger systems, consider:
- WMTMW arrangement (HF-MF-LF-MF-HF)
- Line array configuration
- Constant directivity horns
