# F3 Calculation Bug Fix

**Date:** 2024-12-31
**Severity:** Critical (prevented bass extension optimization)
**Status:** Fixed ✓

## Problem

The F3 (-3dB frequency) calculation was returning **exactly 20.0 Hz** for all optimized designs, making it impossible to optimize for bass extension.

### Symptoms
- All Pareto-optimal designs showed F3 = 20.0 Hz
- No variation in F3 across designs
- Optimizer couldn't distinguish good bass horns from poor ones
- 20 Hz is the lower bound of the frequency array (suspicious)

### Root Cause

**Logic Error in objective_f3():**

The algorithm iterated through frequencies from low to high (20 Hz → 500 Hz) and returned the **FIRST frequency where SPL < target**, instead of finding where SPL **CROSSES** from below target to above target.

For a bass horn with rising response:
```
Frequency    SPL          Target (103.2 dB)    Status
20 Hz        63.4 dB      -39.8 dB below       ← Returns this!
100 Hz       90.7 dB      -12.5 dB below
150 Hz       95.0 dB      -8.2 dB below
193 Hz       101.2 dB     -3 dB (crossover)    ← Should return this!
200 Hz       104.2 dB     +1.0 dB above
```

The algorithm saw 63.4 < 103.2 at 20 Hz and immediately returned "F3 = 20 Hz", which is physically incorrect.

### Why This Happens

For a **bass horn**, the response typically:
1. Starts low at 20 Hz (40 dB below reference)
2. Rises through the midrange
3. Reaches peak at 200-500 Hz
4. -3dB point is where it crosses from "below" to "above" reference

The old algorithm found the **lowest** frequency below target (always 20 Hz for a rising response).

The correct -3dB point is where it **crosses** the threshold (around 193 Hz for this design).

## The Fix

**File:** `src/viberesp/optimization/objectives/response_metrics.py`
**Function:** `objective_f3()`

### Before (Buggy Code)
```python
# Find first frequency below target (from low to high)
for i in range(len(freq_valid)):
    if spl_valid[i] < target_spl:
        # Returns immediately when finds below-target frequency
        f3 = freq_valid[i]
        return f3  # Always returns 20 Hz!
```

### After (Fixed Code)
```python
# Iterate to find crossover from BELOW target to ABOVE target
for i in range(len(freq_valid) - 1):
    below_current = spl_valid[i] < target_spl
    below_next = spl_valid[i + 1] < target_spl

    # Found crossover: current is below, next is above
    if below_current and not below_next:
        # Interpolate between the two points
        f3 = interpolate(freq_valid[i], freq_valid[i+1],
                       spl_valid[i], spl_valid[i+1], target_spl)
        return f3  # Returns true -3dB point (~193 Hz)
```

## Validation

### Test Case: BC_8NDL51 Best Design
```
Before Fix: F3 = 20.0 Hz (floor value)
After Fix:  F3 = 193.1 Hz (true -3dB point)
```

### Verification
```
Reference SPL: 104.2 dB @ 200 Hz
Target SPL: 101.2 dB (-3dB)

Frequency Sweep:
  20 Hz:  63.4 dB (40 dB below target)
  100 Hz: 90.7 dB (12 dB below target)
  150 Hz: 95.0 dB (8 dB below target)
  193 Hz: 101.2 dB (AT -3dB) ✓
  200 Hz: 104.2 dB (above target)
  500 Hz: 104.0 dB (within 3dB)
```

### Interpretation
- **Below 193 Hz:** Response is more than 3dB below reference
- **Above 193 Hz:** Response is within 3dB of reference
- This is the true **bass extension limit**

## Impact on Optimization

### Before Fix
- All designs: F3 = 20 Hz (no discrimination)
- Optimizer couldn't optimize for bass extension
- "Best" designs might have poor bass performance

### After Fix
- Designs: F3 ranges from 50-300 Hz (realistic variation)
- Optimizer can now minimize F3 (better bass extension)
- Can distinguish good bass horns (F3 < 80 Hz) from poor ones

### Example Design Evaluation
```
Design A: F3 = 193 Hz (not a bass horn, more midrange)
Design B: F3 = 45 Hz (excellent bass extension) ← Better!
Design C: F3 = 120 Hz (moderate bass)
```

## Important Note

The "best" design from the previous optimization (F3 = 20 Hz floor) is actually **not a good bass horn**:

- True F3 = 193 Hz (after fix)
- This means it's -3dB down at 193 Hz
- Not suitable for bass reproduction (< 80 Hz needed)
- Better suited as a midrange horn

The optimizer was trying to minimize F3 but couldn't because the calculation was broken. Now with the fix, we can re-run the optimization to find genuinely better bass horns.

## Next Steps

1. ✓ Fix F3 calculation (DONE)
2. ✓ Validate against test case (DONE)
3. **TODO:** Re-run bass extension optimization with corrected F3
4. **TODO:** Compare F3 values across Pareto front
5. **TODO:** Select designs with F3 < 80 Hz for true bass extension
