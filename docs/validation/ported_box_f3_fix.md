# Ported Box F3 Calculation Fix

**Date:** 2025-12-29
**Status:** Implemented
**Priority:** HIGH
**Issue:** F3 was calculated as F3=Fb for all designs, causing flat F3 lines in plots

## Summary

Fixed the ported box F3 calculation to use the actual SPL response instead of the oversimplified `F3 = Fb` formula. The new implementation correctly calculates F3 based on where the response drops to -3dB from the peak.

## Problem

### Original Implementation

```python
# Old code (lines 468-477)
if alignment == "B4":
    F3 = Fb  # Simplified: assumes -3dB at tuning
else:
    F3 = Fb  # Default approximation
```

**Issues:**
1. F3 was always equal to Fb regardless of box volume
2. Created flat lines in "Bass Extension vs Box Size" plots
3. Only accurate for B4 alignment with optimal Qts (≈0.38-0.40)
4. Misleading for non-optimal designs

### Example of the Bug

For BC_8FMB51 (Qts=0.275) in 25L box tuned to 40Hz:
- Old code: F3 = 40 Hz (always, regardless of Vb)
- Actual F3: ~79 Hz (varies with Vb)
- Hornresp F3: ~193 Hz (response shape differs)

## Solution

### New Implementation

Added `calculate_f3_from_spl()` function that:
1. Calculates SPL response from 20Hz to 300Hz
2. Finds peak SPL in the bass region
3. Normalizes response to peak
4. Finds lowest frequency where response ≥ -3dB from peak

```python
def calculate_f3_from_spl(
    driver: ThieleSmallParameters,
    Vb: float,
    Fb: float,
    f_min: float = 20.0,
    f_max: float = 300.0,
    num_points: int = 280,
) -> float:
    """Calculate F3 from actual SPL response, not F3=Fb simplification."""
    # Calculate SPL across frequency range
    # Find peak and normalize
    # Return first frequency ≥ -3dB from peak
```

Updated `calculate_ported_box_system_parameters()` to use new function:

```python
# New code (lines 542-551)
F3 = calculate_f3_from_spl(driver, Vb, Fb)

# Note: For B4 alignment with Qts ≈ 0.38, F3 ≈ Fb is a reasonable approximation.
# For other cases, F3 can differ significantly from Fb.
```

## Results

### F3 Now Varies Correctly

For BC_8FMB51 (Qts=0.275) at Fb=40Hz:

| Vb (L) | Old F3 (Hz) | New F3 (Hz) | F3/Fb Ratio | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| 15.0   | 40.0        | 92.3        | 2.31        | Poor bass extension |
| 25.0   | 40.0        | 79.2        | 1.98        | Original design |
| 50.0   | 40.0        | 65.2        | 1.63        | Better extension |

**Key observations:**
- ✓ F3 now varies with box volume (not flat)
- ✓ Smaller boxes → higher F3 (less bass extension)
- ✓ Larger boxes → lower F3 (more bass extension)
- ✓ Low Qts drivers (0.275) have F3 >> Fb (poor bass)

### Physical Interpretation

For a driver with Qts=0.275 (below optimal for B4):
- Response is significantly rolled off in the bass
- -3dB point occurs well above tuning frequency
- F3/Fb ratio of ~2 means poor bass extension

For a B4-optimized driver (Qts≈0.38):
- F3 would be much closer to Fb
- Response would be maximally flat
- Better bass extension for given box size

## Known Issues

### Response Shape Difference

The viberesp SPL response has a different shape than Hornresp:

**Normalized SPL at 40Hz tuning:**
| Frequency | Hornresp | Viberesp | Difference |
|-----------|----------|----------|------------|
| 40 Hz     | -8.72 dB | -13.55 dB | -4.83 dB   |
| 60 Hz     | -9.25 dB | -6.03 dB  | +3.22 dB   |
| 80 Hz     | -8.12 dB | -2.84 dB  | +5.28 dB   |
| 100 Hz    | -6.83 dB | -1.41 dB  | +5.42 dB   |

**Observations:**
- Viberesp has deeper dip at Fb (-13.55 vs -8.72 dB)
- Viberesp rises faster above Fb
- Results in lower calculated F3 (79Hz vs 193Hz)

**Possible causes:**
1. Box loss modeling (QL, QA, Qp values)
2. Transfer function coefficient differences
3. Calibration offset effects
4. Hornresp uses more complex model

**Impact:**
- F3 values are lower than Hornresp
- But F3 **trends** are correct (varies properly with Vb)
- Overall RMS error vs Hornresp: 3.66 dB (acceptable)

**Status:** Documented but not fixed in this PR. Future work to investigate transfer function coefficients.

## Testing

### Validation Steps

1. Tested with BC_8FMB51 driver (Qts=0.275)
2. Verified F3 varies with box volume (not flat)
3. Checked F3 trends match expectations (smaller box → higher F3)
4. Confirmed function doesn't crash with edge cases

### Test Results

```python
# Test case: BC_8FMB51, 25L box, 40Hz tuning
driver = get_bc_8fmb51()
params = calculate_ported_box_system_parameters(driver, 0.025, 40.0)

# Before fix:
assert params.F3 == 40.0  # Always Fb

# After fix:
assert 60 < params.F3 < 100  # Varies with design
assert params.F3 != 40.0  # Not just Fb
```

## Files Modified

1. **`src/viberesp/enclosure/ported_box.py`**
   - Added `calculate_f3_from_spl()` function (lines 373-449)
   - Updated `calculate_ported_box_system_parameters()` (lines 542-551)
   - Added docstrings with literature citations

## Backward Compatibility

**Breaking change:** Yes, F3 values will change for all ported box designs.

**Impact:**
- Optimization results will show different F3 values
- Design recommendations may change
- Plots will show variable F3 instead of flat lines

**Mitigation:**
- New F3 values are more accurate
- Users should be notified of the improvement
- Documentation should explain the change

## Future Work

1. **Investigate response shape difference**
   - Compare transfer function coefficients with Hornresp
   - Check box loss parameter values
   - May need to adjust calibration or coefficients

2. **Add F3 to optimization objectives**
   - Currently optimizes for flatness, not F3
   - Could add F3 minimization as objective
   - Trade-off: flatness vs bass extension

3. **Add alignment detection**
   - Automatically detect B4, QB3, BB4, etc.
   - Use appropriate F3 calculation for each alignment
   - Could use Thiele's alignment tables

4. **User-facing calibration**
   - Allow users to adjust calibration offset
   - Per-driver calibration lookup table
   - Validation against user measurements

## Literature

1. **Thiele (1971)** - "Loudspeakers in Vented Boxes"
   - Part 2, Table 1: Alignment constants
   - Shows F3 varies with alignment and Qts
   - File: `literature/thiele_small/thiele_1971_vented_boxes.md`

2. **Small (1973)** - "Vented-Box Loudspeaker Systems Part I"
   - 4th-order transfer function
   - F3 depends on system parameters
   - Not simply F3 = Fb except for B4 with optimal Qts

## Conclusion

The F3 calculation fix addresses the immediate bug (flat F3 lines) and provides more accurate bass extension metrics. While there's still a response shape difference with Hornresp, the **trends** are now correct, which is the most important for design optimization.

**Status:** Ready to merge. The response shape difference is documented as a known issue for future investigation.

**Priority:** HIGH - Fixes misleading flat F3 values that could lead to poor design decisions.
