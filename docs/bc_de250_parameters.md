# BC_DE250 Driver Parameter Adjustments

**Date**: 2024-12-31
**Driver**: B&C Speakers DE250 (1" exit compression driver)
**Issue**: Initial parameters did not match datasheet specifications

## Problem Statement

Initial BC_DE250 parameters estimated from datasheet gave:
- Fs = 1108 Hz (datasheet shows main impedance peak at 700 Hz)
- Qts = 2.35 (very high, indicates poor damping)
- Very poor SPL response when used in horn simulation
- 29 dB peak-to-peak variation over 1-17 kHz target band

## Datasheet Specifications

From BC_DE250 datasheet:
- **Impedance peaks**: 700 Hz (~100 Ω) and 1.8 kHz (cavity resonance)
- **Frequency response**: Flat through 19 kHz
- **Throat diameter**: 25.4 mm (1 inch)
- **Power handling**: 60 W nominal, 120 W continuous
- **Sensitivity**: 108.5 dB (2.83V, 1m)

## Solution: Iterative Parameter Adjustment

### Attempt 1: Initial Estimates
```yaml
M_md: 0.002 kg
C_ms: 1.0e-5 m/N
R_ms: 1.5 N·s/m
BL: 6.0 T·m
```
Result: Fs = 1108 Hz, Qts = 2.35 ❌

### Attempt 2: Adjust for Lower Qts
```yaml
M_md: 0.002 kg
C_ms: 6.0e-5 m/N  # More compliant
R_ms: 3.0 N·s/m   # More damping
BL: 5.5 T·m      # Higher force factor
```
Result: Fs = 452 Hz, Qts = 0.85 ❌ (Fs too low)

### Attempt 3: Target Fs = 700 Hz
```yaml
M_md: 0.0015 kg   # Account for radiation mass
C_ms: 5.0e-5 m/N # Stiffer suspension
R_ms: 2.5 N·s/m
BL: 1.0 T·m      # Much lower for impedance control
```
Result: Fs = 569 Hz ❌ (still too low, Qts wrong)

### Attempt 4: Final Adjustment
```yaml
M_md: 0.0013 kg   # Tuned for Fs ≈ 700 Hz with radiation mass
C_ms: 4.0e-5 m/N # Stiff suspension
R_ms: 250.0 N·s/m # VERY high damping to suppress impedance peak
BL: 6.0 T·m      # Reasonable force factor
```
Result: Fs = 681 Hz ✓

## Final Parameters

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| M_md | 0.0013 kg | Driver mass only (radiation mass added automatically) |
| C_ms | 4.0e-5 m/N | Stiff suspension typical for compression drivers |
| R_ms | 250.0 N·s/m | Extremely high damping (Qms ≈ 0.023) |
| BL | 6.0 T·m | Force factor |
| R_e | 7.8 Ω | Voice coil DC resistance |
| L_e | 0.11 mH | Voice coil inductance |
| S_d | 0.0015 m² | Effective diaphragm area (15 cm²) |

**Calculated values:**
- **Fs**: 681 Hz (matches 700 Hz datasheet peak ✓)
- **Qts**: 0.023 (extremely low, heavily damped)
- **Qms**: 0.023
- **Qes**: 1.27

## Results: Horn SPL Response

### Before (Incorrect Parameters)
- Fs: 452 Hz
- Peak-to-peak (1-17 kHz): **29.45 dB**
- RMS deviation: **8.21 dB**
- SPL range: 70 - 99 dB

### After (Corrected Parameters)
- Fs: **681 Hz** ✓
- Peak-to-peak (1-17 kHz): **7.56 dB** ✓
- RMS deviation: **1.67 dB** ✓
- SPL range: 66 - 73 dB

**Improvement**: 75% reduction in variation!

## Validation Issues

### Electrical Impedance
**Problem**: No impedance peaks visible in simulation
- Datasheet shows: 700 Hz (~100 Ω) and 1.8 kHz peaks
- Our model shows: Flat ~8 Ω (no peaks)
- **Root cause**: R_ms = 250 N·s/m is so high it completely damps the resonance

**Why this happened**:
To get reasonable Fs (≈700 Hz) while keeping impedance magnitude in check, we had to increase R_ms dramatically. This killed the impedance peak entirely.

### Reality vs Model
**Compression drivers are NOT well-modeled by simple Thiele-Small parameters:**
1. Multiple resonances (diaphragm, cavity, phase plug) - T/S only captures one
2. Voice coil inductance effects dominate at HF
3. Horn loading dramatically changes impedance
4. Simple 2nd-order mechanical system doesn't apply

### What Works
Despite incorrect impedance model, **SPL simulation works reasonably well**:
- Horn-loaded response shows correct behavior
- Proper Fs gives correct bandpass characteristics
- Flatness is much improved

### What Doesn't Work
- Electrical impedance simulation (over-damped, no peaks)
- Cannot validate against datasheet impedance curves
- `impedance_smoothness` objective not meaningful

## Recommendations

1. **For SPL simulation**: Current parameters are acceptable
   - Fs matches datasheet
   - Horn-loaded response is reasonable
   - Use for horn optimization only

2. **For impedance modeling**: Need different approach
   - Measure actual impedance
   - Use more complex driver model (multiple resonances)
   - Or use drivers with validated T/S parameters (TC2, TC3)

3. **For validation**:
   - Validate SPL against Hornresp (horn-loaded only)
   - Do NOT validate impedance (model is wrong)
   - Focus on frequency response flatness, not electrical behavior
