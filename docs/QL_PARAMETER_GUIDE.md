# QL Parameter Guide - Enclosure Losses

**Last Updated:** 2025-12-29

---

## Overview

**QL (Leakage Q)** represents enclosure leakage and absorption losses in loudspeaker enclosures. It models how "lossy" the box is - lower QL means more losses (damping), higher QL means fewer losses (more ideal).

---

## Default Values in viberesp

**All ported box functions use QL = 7.0 as the default:**

```python
# Main user-facing function
ported_box_electrical_impedance(..., QL=7.0)

# Electro-mechanical coupling functions (recommended)
calculate_spl_ported_vector_sum(..., QL=7.0)
calculate_spl_ported_vector_sum_array(..., QL=7.0)

# System parameter calculation
calculate_ported_box_system_parameters(..., QL=7.0)

# Legacy transfer function
calculate_spl_ported_transfer_function(..., QL=7.0)
```

## Physical Meaning

### What QL Represents

QL models **energy losses** in the enclosure:

1. **Air leakage** through gaps, seams, driver mounting
2. **Absorption** by damping material (polyfill, foam, etc.)
3. **Wall vibration** and cabinet flexing

### QL Value Ranges

| QL Value | Loss Level | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **QL = 5-7** | Typical losses | Most practical enclosures with some absorption |
| **QL = 10-15** | Low losses | Well-sealed box, minimal absorption |
| **QL = 20-30** | Very low losses | Excellent construction, airtight |
| **QL = 100+** | Near-lossless | Theoretical ideal (Hornresp validation) |

## Effect on Frequency Response

### Bass Region (20-100 Hz)

**QL significantly affects bass output near port tuning (Fb):**

For BC_8FMB51 (B4 alignment, Fb=67 Hz):
```
QL=7:  -1.4 dB at Fb (67 Hz) compared to lossless
QL=100:  0.0 dB reference (lossless)
```

**Maximum effect: ~3 dB at Fb when comparing QL=7 to QL=100**

### Midrange (80-2000 Hz)

**QL has minimal effect on midrange:**

```
Midrange flatness (80-2000 Hz):
  QL=7:  σ = 1.17 dB
  QL=100: σ = 1.12 dB
  Difference: 0.05 dB (negligible!)
```

**Practical implication:** QL choice does NOT affect midrange clarity or vocal reproduction.

### Crossover Region (1500-3000 Hz)

**QL has NO effect above 1500 Hz:**

```
All QL values: σ = 1.28 dB (identical!)
```

**Practical implication:** Crossover integration with HF horn is unaffected by QL.

## When to Use Different QL Values

### QL = 7 (Recommended for Most Designs)

**Use for:**
- Typical bookshelf speakers with some damping
- Designs with subwoofer (sub handles deep bass)
- Critical midrange applications (vocals, instruments)

**Why:** Realistic losses, matches most actual enclosures

### QL = 10-15 (Well-Sealed Enclosure)

**Use for:**
- High-quality construction with excellent sealing
- Designs wanting slightly more bass output
- Floor-standing speakers with minimal damping

**Why:** Slightly more output near Fb, still midrange-neutral

### QL = 20-30 (Audiophile Construction)

**Use for:**
- Reference-quality enclosures
- Extensive bracing and sealing
- Professional studio monitors

**Why:** Maximum bass output from given box size

### QL = 100 (Validation Only)

**Use for:**
- Validation against Hornresp (lossless simulation)
- Theoretical calculations
- Comparison with published specs

**Why:** Matches Hornresp's idealized model

## QL vs Other Loss Parameters

Ported boxes have three loss parameters:

```
1/QB = 1/QL + 1/QA + 1/QP

Where:
- QL = Leakage losses (air gaps, seams) [DEFAULT: 7.0]
- QA = Absorption losses (damping material) [DEFAULT: 100.0 ≈ negligible]
- QP = Port losses (viscous effects) [AUTO-CALCULATED]
- QB = Total combined losses
```

### QA (Absorption Losses)

**Default: QA = 100.0**

Most users don't need to adjust QA. It represents:
- Damping material absorption
- Internal wall losses
- Typically QA >> QL, so QB ≈ QL

**Only adjust QA if:**
- You have extensive damping material (QA = 50-70)
- You want to model specific absorption (rare)

### QP (Port Losses)

**Auto-calculated from port dimensions**

QP accounts for:
- Viscous boundary layer losses in port
- Thermal losses
- End corrections

**No manual adjustment needed** - calculated automatically.

## Validation Against Hornresp

### For Hornresp Comparison

**Use QL = 100 (lossless):**

```python
# Validation mode
spl = calculate_spl_ported_vector_sum(
    frequency=50,
    driver=driver,
    Vb=Vb,
    Fb=Fb,
    port_area=port_area,
    port_length=port_length,
    QL=100.0  # Lossless for Hornresp validation
)
```

**Why:** Hornresp idealizes QL to ∞ (lossless). Using QL=100 matches this.

### For Real Designs

**Use QL = 7 (realistic):**

```python
# Design mode
spl = calculate_spl_ported_vector_sum(
    frequency=50,
    driver=driver,
    Vb=Vb,
    Fb=Fb,
    port_area=port_area,
    port_length=port_length,
    QL=7.0  # Realistic box losses
)
```

**Why:** Matches what you'll actually build.

## Recommendations

### For Bookshelf Speakers

**Use QL = 7-10:**
- Realistic losses
- Subwoofer handles deep bass
- Midrange performance unaffected
- Crossover integration unaffected

### For Standalone Towers

**Use QL = 10-15:**
- Slightly more bass output
- Still neutral midrange
- Good compromise for 2-way or 2.5-way systems

### For Subwoofers

**Use QL = 7:**
- Subwoofer operates < 100 Hz
- QL effect is in target frequency range
- Realistic modeling important

### For Validation

**Use QL = 100:**
- Match Hornresp simulations
- Compare with published specs
- Theoretical calculations

## Technical Details

### How QL is Applied

In electro-mechanical coupling model:

```python
# Box leakage resistance
Ral = (wb * Map) / QL

# Where:
# wb = 2π × Fb (port tuning angular frequency)
# Map = port acoustic mass (transformed to mechanical domain)
# Ral = mechanical resistance representing enclosure losses

# Ral appears in series with port mass
Z_box_branch = s × Map + Ral

# Higher QL → Lower Ral → Less damping → Sharper port resonance
# Lower QL → Higher Ral → More damping → Smoother response
```

## Summary

**Key Takeaways:**

1. ✅ **Default QL = 7** is correct for most designs
2. ✅ **QL only affects bass region** below 100 Hz
3. ✅ **Midrange and crossover are unaffected** by QL choice
4. ✅ **Use QL = 100** only for Hornresp validation
5. ✅ **Array functions updated** with electro-mechanical coupling

**For your BC_8FMB51 bookshelf:**
- Use QL = 7 (default)
- Expect -1.4 dB at 67 Hz compared to lossless
- No effect above 100 Hz (midrange, crossover)
- Perfect for integration with horn HF driver

**Files Updated:**
- `src/viberesp/enclosure/ported_box_vector_sum.py` - QL parameter now used (was hardcoded to 100)
- `src/viberesp/enclosure/ported_box.py` - QL = 7.0 default (already correct)

**Validation:**
- All main functions use QL = 7.0 default
- Electro-mechanical coupling implemented consistently
- Array version updated to match single-frequency version
