"""
Physical constants for acoustic simulations.

This module defines standard conditions and physical constants used
throughout the viberesp simulation code. All values are cited from
the literature.

Literature:
- Kinsler et al. (1982), Chapter 1 - Standard atmospheric conditions
- Beranek (1954), Chapter 1 - Physical properties of air
- Olson (1947), Chapter 1 - Acoustic constants

Validation:
    Values match standard references (Kinsler, Beranek) within
    significant figures.
