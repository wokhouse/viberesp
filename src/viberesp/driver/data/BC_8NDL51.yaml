# Notes and warnings
notes: |
  M_md is driver mass only (excludes radiation mass).
  The datasheet reports Mms = 27g, but this is not entirely consistent with
  the datasheet Fs (75 Hz) and Cms (0.150 mm/N). Using the datasheet Fs and
  Cms values, the theoretical M_ms should be 30.0g, giving M_md = 26.29g
  (driver mass only) after subtracting radiation mass (~3.7g at 75 Hz).

  Radiation mass is calculated internally using Beranek (1954) theory
  to match Hornresp methodology (2× radiation mass for infinite baffle).
