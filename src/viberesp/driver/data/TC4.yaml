# Notes and warnings
notes: |
  TC4 compression driver (midrange horn with both chambers).

  Test case for validating complete front-loaded horn system with both
  throat and rear chambers.

  Parameters from: tests/validation/horn_theory/exp_midrange_tc4/horn_params.txt

  Horn specifications (TC4):
  - Same driver and horn as TC2
  - Throat chamber: Vtc = 0.5 L, Atc = 5.0 cm²
  - Rear chamber: Vrc = 2.0 L, Lrc = 12.60 cm
