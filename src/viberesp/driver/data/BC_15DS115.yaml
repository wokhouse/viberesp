# Notes and warnings
notes: |
  M_md is driver mass only (excludes radiation mass).
  WARNING: The datasheet Mms value (254g) is NOT consistent with the
  datasheet Fs (33 Hz) and Cms (0.25 mm/N). Using the datasheet Fs and Cms,
  the theoretical M_ms should be 93g, not 254g (63% error in datasheet).

  This implementation uses the datasheet Cms and Fs values, calculating
  M_md = 64.86g (driver mass only) to produce the correct resonance.
  Radiation mass at 33 Hz is ~28.2g, giving M_ms = 93g total.

  Radiation mass is calculated internally using Beranek (1954) theory
  to match Hornresp methodology (2× radiation mass for infinite baffle).
