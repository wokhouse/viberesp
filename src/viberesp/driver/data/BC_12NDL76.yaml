parameters:
  M_md: 0.039898  # kg - driver mass only (calculated from Mms - radiation mass)
  C_ms: 0.00019  # m/N - compliance
  R_ms: 4.0  # N·s/m - mechanical resistance
  R_e: 5.3  # Ohms - voice coil DC resistance
  L_e: 1.0e-3  # H - voice coil inductance

  S_d: 0.0522  # m² - effective area
  X_max: 0.007  # m - maximum linear excursion

# Notes and warnings
notes: |
  M_md is driver mass only (excludes radiation mass).
  The datasheet reports Mms = 53g (total mass including radiation), which
  is consistent with Fs and Cms. Radiation mass at resonance is ~13.4g,
  so M_md = 53g - 13.4g = 39.9g driver mass only.

  Radiation mass is calculated internally using Beranek (1954) theory
  to match Hornresp methodology (2× radiation mass for infinite baffle).
