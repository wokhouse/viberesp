  B&C does not publish Thiele-Small parameters for the DH450 compression driver.
  These are ESTIMATED values suitable for horn optimization approximations.

  Beaming Frequency Calculation:
  - For compression drivers with horns, use THROAT diameter, not diaphragm
  - Formula: f_beam = c / D_throat (where D = throat diameter)
  - Calculation: 343 m/s / 0.025 m = 13,720 Hz
  - Below 13.7 kHz: Horn controls dispersion pattern (throat acoustically small)
  - Above 13.7 kHz: Driver beams, throat acts as directional source
  - This applies to ALL compression drivers with 1" (25mm) throat
  - DH350 and DH450 have the SAME beaming frequency (same throat size)

  Theory:
  - Phase plug transforms wavefront from diaphragm to throat exit
  - Throat becomes the effective acoustic radiator for the horn
  - Literature: Kolbrek & Dunker on horn upper frequency limits
  - Literature: Beranek (1954) on throat impedance and ka relationship
  - Validated: Matches Hornresp simulation (uses throat entry area S1)

  Comparison: DH450 vs DH350
  - Both have 1" throat → same beaming frequency → similar HF performance
  - DH450: Higher sensitivity (110 vs 108 dB), 16Ω vs 4Ω, 18kHz vs 17kHz response
  - For 2-way flatness validation: Both perform similarly within tolerance

  Parameter estimation rationale:
  - M_md (~1.7g): Similar to DH350, 44mm voice coil
  - C_ms (1.3e-5 m/N): Stiff suspension typical for compression drivers
  - S_d (~14 cm²): Based on 44mm diaphragm (similar to DH350)
  - BL (~5.8 T·m): Estimated from 1.9T flux density and 44mm voice coil
  - X_max (~0.3mm): Standard compression driver excursion
  - R_e (12.3Ω): Minimum impedance from datasheet (16Ω nominal)

  Horn optimizer usage:
  - Driver is designed for HF horns (1kHz - 18kHz per datasheet)
  - Recommended crossover at 1kHz
  - High sensitivity (110 dB) and 16Ω impedance for flexible system design

  CAUTION: These are ESTIMATED values. For accurate simulation results,
  measure actual Thiele-Small parameters or obtain from B&C.
