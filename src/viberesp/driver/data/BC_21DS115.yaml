# Notes and warnings
notes: |
  M_md is driver mass only (excludes radiation mass).
  The datasheet Mms=390g, Fs=36Hz, and Vas=198L are consistent when
  using the standard Thiele-Small relationships.

  Calculated from datasheet Mms=390g and Fs=36Hz:
  - C_ms = 5.053e-5 m/N (from Vas=198L, Sd=1680cm²)
  - R_ms = 10.50 N·s/m (from Qms=8.4)
  - M_md = 0.309 kg (optimized to match Fs=36Hz with Hornresp radiation mass)

  Resulting values (match datasheet):
  - Fs ≈ 36.0 Hz ✓
  - Qes ≈ 0.31 ✓
  - Qms ≈ 8.3 ✓
  - Qts ≈ 0.30 ✓
  - Vas ≈ 198 L ✓

  Radiation mass is calculated internally using Beranek (1954) theory
  to match Hornresp methodology (2× radiation mass for infinite baffle).
