# Notes and warnings
notes: |
  TC2 compression driver (midrange horn).

  Test case for validating horn simulation and optimization against Hornresp.
  This driver represents a compression driver loaded by an exponential horn
  with no throat or rear chambers.

  Parameters from: tests/validation/horn_theory/exp_midrange_tc2/horn_params.txt

  Horn specifications (TC2):
  - Throat area (S1): 5.0 cm²
  - Mouth area (S2): 200.0 cm²
  - Length (L12): 0.5 m
  - Cutoff frequency: ~404 Hz
  - No throat chamber (Vtc = 0)
  - No rear chamber (Vrc = 0)
