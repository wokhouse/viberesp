# Notes and warnings
notes: |
  B&C does not publish Thiele-Small parameters for the DH350 compression driver.
  These are ESTIMATED values suitable for horn optimization approximations.

  Parameter estimation rationale:
  - M_md (~1.8g): Lighter than DE250 due to smaller 36mm voice coil vs 44mm
  - C_ms (1.2e-5 m/N): Very stiff suspension, typical for compression drivers
  - S_d (~14 cm²): Based on typical diaphragm size for compact 1" throat drivers
    (diaphragm is typically 1.5-2× throat diameter)
  - BL (~5 T·m): Estimated from 1.8T flux density and 36mm voice coil
    (lower than DE250 due to smaller coil diameter)
  - X_max (~0.3mm): Compression drivers have very limited excursion
  - R_e (4.1Ω): Minimum impedance from datasheet
  - Lower power handling (30W) vs DE250 (120W) reflects compact design

  Horn optimizer usage:
  - Driver is designed for HF horns (1kHz - 17kHz)
  - Recommended crossover at 1kHz (lower than DE250's 1.6kHz)
  - High sensitivity (108 dB) suggests high efficiency
  - 4 ohm impedance allows higher output voltage for given power

  CAUTION: These are approximate values. For accurate simulation results,
  measure actual Thiele-Small parameters or obtain from B&C.

  Comparison to DE250:
  - 40% smaller voice coil (36mm vs 44mm)
  - 50% lower power handling (30W vs 120W)
  - Same throat size (1" exit)
  - Similar sensitivity (108 vs 108.5 dB)
  - Lower inductance (0.06 vs 0.11 mH) suggests better HF extension
