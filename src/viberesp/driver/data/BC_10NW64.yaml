# Notes and warnings
notes: |
  M_md is driver mass only (excludes radiation mass).
  The datasheet reports Mms = 47g. M_ms is calculated from Fs and C_ms:
  M_ms = 1 / ((2π·Fs)² · C_ms) = 47.0g

  Radiation mass at 59 Hz is ~3.22g per side (from Beranek piston theory),
  giving M_md = 47.0g - 2×3.22g = 40.57g.

  C_ms is calculated from Vas using the relationship:
  C_ms = Vas / (ρ₀ · c² · S_d²)

  R_ms is calculated from Qms using the relationship:
  R_ms = (1/Qms) · √(M_ms/C_ms)

  Radiation mass is calculated internally using Beranek (1954) theory
  to match Hornresp methodology (2× radiation mass for infinite baffle).
