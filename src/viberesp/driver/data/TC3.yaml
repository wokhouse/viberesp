# Notes and warnings
notes: |
  TC3 compression driver (midrange horn with throat chamber).

  Test case for validating horn simulation with throat chamber compliance.
  Same driver as TC2, but with a 0.5L throat chamber between driver and horn.

  Parameters from: tests/validation/horn_theory/exp_midrange_tc3/horn_params.txt

  Horn specifications (TC3):
  - Same driver and horn as TC2
  - Throat chamber: Vtc = 0.5 L, Atc = 5.0 cm²
  - No rear chamber (Vrc = 0)
