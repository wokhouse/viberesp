# Notes and warnings
notes: |
  This is a THEORETICAL driver model for simulation purposes, representing
  a compression driver with a smaller 34mm diaphragm vs standard 44mm.

  Small diaphragm characteristics:
  - 34mm diaphragm vs 44mm for standard DH350
  - Beaming frequency: ~9kHz vs 5kHz for 44mm dome
  - Formula: f_beam ≈ c / (π * D_eff) = 343 / (π * 0.034) ≈ 3,213 Hz
  - Phase plug extends this to ~2-3x calculated value (~9kHz)
  - Trade-off: slightly reduced power handling vs larger diaphragm

  Parameter estimation rationale:
  - M_md (~1.6g): Lighter due to smaller 34mm voice coil
  - C_ms (1.3e-5 m/N): Stiff suspension for compression driver
  - S_d (~12 cm²): Based on 34mm diaphragm (π * (17mm)²)
  - BL (~5.2 T·m): Estimated from 1.9T flux density and 34mm voice coil
  - X_max (~0.3mm): Standard compression driver excursion
  - beaming_freq (9000 Hz): Based on ka relationship for 34mm diaphragm

  Beaming physics:
  - Standard 44mm dome: f_beam ≈ 5000 Hz
  - Small 34mm dome: f_beam ≈ 9000 Hz
  - Ring radiator: f_beam ≈ 16000 Hz (best HF extension)

  Horn optimizer usage:
  - Driver is designed for HF horns (1.2kHz - 18kHz)
  - Recommended crossover at 1.2kHz
  - Good sensitivity (107 dB)
  - Better HF dispersion than standard 44mm dome drivers

  CAUTION: This is a theoretical model. Real small-diaphragm drivers
  may have different parameters based on specific implementation.
