# Notes and warnings
notes: |
  This is a THEORETICAL driver model for simulation purposes, representing
  an ideal ring radiator compression driver.

  Ring radiator characteristics:
  - V-shaped ring instead of dome reduces effective radiating width
  - Moving mass driven at center of ring
  - Pushes beaming frequency to >16 kHz (vs 5 kHz for standard dome)
  - Higher sensitivity due to reduced mass
  - Better high-frequency extension with constant directivity

  Parameter estimation rationale:
  - M_md (~1.5g): Lighter than dome due to ring design
  - C_ms (1.5e-5 m/N): Stiff suspension typical for compression drivers
  - S_d (~10 cm²): Ring has less area than dome (14 cm² for DH350)
  - BL (~5.5 T·m): Estimated from 2.0T flux density and 36mm voice coil
  - X_max (~0.2mm): Limited excursion for ring design
  - beaming_freq (16000 Hz): Ring geometry delays beaming significantly

  Horn optimizer usage:
  - Driver is designed for extended HF response (1.5kHz - 20kHz)
  - Recommended crossover at 1.5kHz
  - Very high sensitivity (110 dB) due to ring efficiency
  - Excellent high-frequency dispersion up to 16kHz

  CAUTION: This is a theoretical model. Real ring radiators may have
  different parameters based on specific implementation.
