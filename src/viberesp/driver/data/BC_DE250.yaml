# Physical parameters (adjusted to match BC_DE250 datasheet)
# Datasheet shows:
# - 2 impedance peaks: 700 Hz (main) and 1.8 kHz (cavity resonance)
# - Flat response through 19 kHz
# - Impedance peaks around 100 Ω
#
# Note: Compression driver impedance is dominated by inductance, not mechanical
# resonance. Simple T/S model doesn't capture this well. These parameters are
# tuned to give approximately correct Fs while keeping impedance reasonable.
parameters:
  M_md: 0.0013  # kg - tuned to give Fs~700Hz with radiation mass
  C_ms: 4.0e-5  # m/N - stiff suspension
  R_ms: 250.0  # N·s/m - VERY high damping to suppress impedance peak
  R_e: 7.8  # Ohms - voice coil DC resistance
  L_e: 0.11e-3  # H - voice coil inductance
  BL: 6.0  # T·m - reasonable force factor
  S_d: 0.0015  # m² - effective diaphragm area (~15 cm²)
  X_max: 0.0003  # m - maximum linear excursion

# Compression driver specific parameters
compression_driver:
  throat_diameter: 0.0254  # m - 1 inch exit
  throat_area: 5.07e-4  # m² - π × (12.7mm)²
  front_chamber_volume: 15e-6  # m³ - Front cavity (~15 cc, typical for 1" drivers)

# Notes and warnings
notes: |
  B&C does not publish Thiele-Small parameters for the DE250 compression driver.
  These are ESTIMATED values suitable for horn optimization approximations.

  Parameter estimation rationale:
  - M_md (~2g): Typical for 1" exit compression drivers with 44mm voice coils
  - C_ms (1.0e-5 m/N): Very stiff suspension, typical for compression drivers
  - S_d (~15 cm²): Based on typical diaphragm size for 1" throat drivers
    (diaphragm is typically 1.5-2× throat diameter)
  - BL (~6 T·m): Estimated from 1.85T flux density and 44mm voice coil
  - X_max (~0.3mm): Compression drivers have very limited excursion
  - R_e (7.8Ω): Minimum impedance from datasheet

  Horn optimizer usage:
  - Driver is designed for HF horns (1kHz - 18kHz)
  - Recommended crossover at 1.6kHz
  - High sensitivity (108.5 dB) suggests high efficiency

  CAUTION: These are approximate values. For accurate simulation results,
  measure actual Thiele-Small parameters or obtain from B&C.
