# Notes and warnings
notes: |
  B&C does not publish Thiele-Small parameters for the DE250 compression driver.
  These are ESTIMATED values suitable for horn optimization approximations.

  Parameter estimation rationale:
  - M_md (~2g): Typical for 1" exit compression drivers with 44mm voice coils
  - C_ms (1.0e-5 m/N): Very stiff suspension, typical for compression drivers
  - S_d (~15 cm²): Based on typical diaphragm size for 1" throat drivers
    (diaphragm is typically 1.5-2× throat diameter)
  - BL (~6 T·m): Estimated from 1.85T flux density and 44mm voice coil
  - X_max (~0.3mm): Compression drivers have very limited excursion
  - R_e (7.8Ω): Minimum impedance from datasheet

  Horn optimizer usage:
  - Driver is designed for HF horns (1kHz - 18kHz)
  - Recommended crossover at 1.6kHz
  - High sensitivity (108.5 dB) suggests high efficiency

  CAUTION: These are approximate values. For accurate simulation results,
  measure actual Thiele-Small parameters or obtain from B&C.
