    Calculate complete electrical impedance response for direct radiator in infinite baffle.

    This function implements the complete electro-mechano-acoustical model of a

    impedance calculations with radiation impedance loading and computes the
    resulting sound pressure level.

    Model Description:
        The electrical impedance consists of:
        1. Voice coil impedance: Z_vc (depends on model)
        2. Reflected mechanical impedance: Z_mech = (BL)² / Z_m_total
        3. Acoustic loading from radiation impedance

        The mechanical impedance includes:
        - Mechanical mass: jωM_ms
        - Mechanical compliance: 1/(jωC_ms)
        - Mechanical resistance: R_ms
        - Acoustic radiation load (scaled by 1/S_d²)

        The SPL is calculated from the diaphragm volume velocity using
        the piston-in-infinite-baffle radiation model.

        measurement_distance: Distance for SPL measurement in m, default 1m
        speed_of_sound: Speed of sound in m/s, default 343 m/s at 20°C
        air_density: Air density in kg/m³, default 1.18 kg/m³ at 20°C
        voice_coil_model: Voice coil impedance model, default "simple"
            - "simple": Standard jωL_e model (lossless inductor)
            - "leach": Leach (2002) lossy inductance model (accounts for eddy currents)
        leach_K: Leach model K parameter (Ω·s^n), required for "leach" model
                 - For BC 8NDL51: K ≈ 2.7
        leach_n: Leach model n parameter (loss exponent), required for "leach" model
                 - n = 0: Pure resistor (maximum losses)
                 - n = 1: Lossless inductor (no losses)
                 - For BC 8NDL51: n ≈ 0

    Returns:
        Dictionary containing:
        - 'frequency': Frequency (Hz)
        - 'Ze_magnitude': Electrical impedance magnitude (Ω)
        - 'Ze_phase': Electrical impedance phase (degrees)

        - 'radiation_resistance': Radiation resistance (Pa·s/m³)
        - 'radiation_reactance': Radiation reactance (Pa·s/m³)

    Raises:
        ValueError: If frequency <= 0 or other invalid inputs

    Examples:
        >>> from viberesp.driver import load_driver
        >>> # Simple model (lossless inductor)
        >>> result = direct_radiator_electrical_impedance(100, driver)
        >>> result['Ze_magnitude']
        5.42...  # Ω
        >>> result['SPL']
        67.2...  # dB SPL at 1m

        >>> # Leach model (lossy inductor, matches Hornresp)
        >>> result_leach = direct_radiator_electrical_impedance(
        ...     20000, driver,
        ...     voice_coil_model="leach",
        ...     leach_K=2.7, leach_n=0.0
        ... )
        >>> result_leach['Ze_magnitude']
        8.0...  # Ω (matches Hornresp)

        At resonance, impedance should peak:
        >>> result_fs = direct_radiator_electrical_impedance(driver.F_s, driver)
        >>> result_fs['Ze_magnitude'] > result['Ze_magnitude']
        True

    Validation:
        Compare with Hornresp infinite baffle simulation.
        Expected tolerances (with I_active force model):
        - Electrical impedance magnitude: <2% above resonance, <5% near resonance
        - Electrical impedance phase: <5° general, <10° near resonance
        - SPL: <3 dB below 500 Hz, <5 dB 500-2000 Hz, <10 dB 2-20 kHz

        The I_active force model significantly improves high-frequency accuracy:
        - Previous error at 20 kHz: ~26 dB
        - New error at 20 kHz: ~6-8 dB (78% improvement)

    Known Limitations:
        SPL validation fails for 3/4 tested drivers (BC_12NDL76, BC_15DS115, BC_18PZW100)
        with errors up to 10 dB. This is attributed to:
        1. Simple voice coil model (lossless inductor) - Hornresp uses lossy inductance
           models (Leach 2002) that account for eddy currents in the pole piece
        2. Large drivers (S_d > 500 cm²) have higher sensitivity to resonance frequency
           mismatch and radiation impedance effects
        3. Possible cone breakup modes at high frequencies not modeled by T/S parameters

        Future work: Implement Leach (2002) lossy voice coil model for improved high-frequency
        SPL accuracy. See `voice_coil_model="leach"` parameter for experimental implementation.

    #
    # For loudspeakers:

    # - Reactive current stores energy in magnetic field but doesn't do net work
    #
    # At high frequencies, voice coil inductance causes current to lag voltage
    # by ~85°, making I_active = |I|·cos(85°) much smaller than |I|.
    # Using |I| would overestimate force and SPL by 20-26 dB.
