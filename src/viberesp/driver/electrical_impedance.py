    Calculate voice coil impedance using Leach (2002) lossy inductance model.

    The Leach model accounts for eddy current losses in the voice coil and
    magnetic circuit. At high frequencies, these losses cause the voice coil
    to behave more like a resistor than an inductor.

    Literature:
        - Leach (2002), "Loudspeaker Voice-Coil Inductance Losses"
        - COMSOL (2020), Page 4, Eqs. for L_E(ω) and R'_E(ω)
        - literature/thiele_small/leach_2002_voice_coil_inductance.md

    Model:
        The lossy inductor impedance is:
        Z_L(jω) = K·(jω)^n = K·ω^n [cos(nπ/2) + j·sin(nπ/2)]

        This can be represented as a series resistor and inductor:
        R_s = K·ω^n·cos(nπ/2)
        L_s = K·ω^(n-1)·sin(nπ/2)

        Where:
        - K is the impedance scaling factor (Ω·s^n)
        - n is the loss exponent (0 ≤ n ≤ 1)
          - n = 1: Lossless inductor (pure inductance, no losses)
          - n = 0: Pure resistor (no inductance, maximum losses)
          - n = 0.6-0.7: Typical values for voice coils

    Args:
        frequency: Frequency in Hz
        driver: ThieleSmallParameters instance (for R_e)
        K: Impedance scaling factor in Ω·s^n
           - For BC 8NDL51: K ≈ 2.7 (empirically fitted)
        n: Loss exponent (0 ≤ n ≤ 1)
           - For BC 8NDL51: n ≈ 0 (resistive at high frequencies)

    Returns:
        Complex voice coil impedance (Ω)
        - Real part: R_e + R_s (total resistance)
        - Imag part: ω·L_s (total reactance)

    Examples:
        >>> # BC 8NDL51 parameters (fitted to Hornresp)
        >>> driver = ThieleSmallParameters(...)
        >>> Z_vc = voice_coil_impedance_leach(20000, driver, K=2.7, n=0.0)
        >>> abs(Z_vc)  # ≈ 8 Ω at 20 kHz

    Validation:
        Compare with Hornresp voice coil impedance at high frequencies.
        Expected: |Z_vc| approaches constant value (R_e + K) as f increases.

    Notes:
        - At low frequencies, the simple jωL_e model may be sufficient
        - At high frequencies (>1 kHz), Leach model matches measurements better
        - Parameters K and n can be fitted to impedance measurements

    Notes:
        The "leach" model uses a frequency-limited approach:
        - Below leach_crossover_hz: simple jωL_e model (accurate at low frequencies)
        - Above leach_crossover_hz: Leach lossy inductance (accurate at high frequencies)
        This accounts for the physical reality that eddy current losses are
        more significant at high frequencies.
