    Calculate SPL using Small's transfer function for sealed box.

    This function implements Small's transfer function approach, which directly
    gives the normalized pressure response vs frequency. The transfer function
    is a 2nd-order high-pass filter that correctly models the frequency response
    of a sealed-box loudspeaker system.

    Literature:
        - Small (1972), Equation 1 - Normalized pressure response transfer function
        - Small (1972), Eq. 9 - Parallel Q combination
        - Small (1972), Reference efficiency equation (Section 7)

        - literature/thiele_small/small_1972_closed_box.md
        - Research: tasks/ported_box_transfer_function_research_brief.md

    Transfer Function (Small 1972, Eq. 1):
        G(s) = (s²/ωc²) / [s²/ωc² + s/(Qtc'·ωc) + 1]

    where:
        - s = jω (complex frequency variable)
        - ωc = 2πfc (system cutoff angular frequency)
        - fc = Fs × √(1 + α) (system resonance frequency)
        - Qtc' = Total system Q including mechanical losses (parallel combination)
        - α = Vas/Vb (compliance ratio)

    System Q with Mechanical Losses:
        Small (1972), Eq. 9: Parallel Q combination
        Qtc' = (Qec × Quc) / (Qec + Quc)

        Where:
        - Qec = Qes × √(1 + α)  # Electrical Q at system resonance
        - Quc = Mechanical + absorption losses

    Reference SPL Calculation:
        The reference efficiency is calculated from Small (1972):
        η₀ = (ρ₀/2πc) × (4π²Fs³Vas/Qes)

        For sealed box in the passband, the system efficiency equals the driver efficiency:
        η = η₀  (Small 1972, Part II, Eq. 23)

        Reference SPL at 1W/1m:
        SPL_ref = 20·log₁₀(√(η·P_ref·ρ₀·c/(2π·r²)) / p_ref)

        where:
            P_ref = V²/R_nominal (reference power)
            r = measurement_distance
            p_ref = 20 μPa

    High-Frequency Roll-off:
        When f_mass is provided, applies high-frequency roll-off combining:
        - Voice coil inductance roll-off (6 dB/octave above f_Le)
        - Mass roll-off (6 dB/octave above f_mass)
        - Combined creates 12 dB/octave roll-off when f_mass ≈ f_le

        Two implementation methods:
        1. use_complex_tf=False (default): Post-correct SPL in dB (legacy method)
        2. use_complex_tf=True: Multiply complex transfer functions (more accurate)

        Method 2 is recommended as it properly models the electromechanical coupling.

    Args:
        frequency: Frequency in Hz
        driver: ThieleSmallParameters instance
        Vb: Box volume (m³)
        voltage: Input voltage (V), default 2.83V (1W into 8Ω)
        measurement_distance: SPL measurement distance (m), default 1m
        speed_of_sound: Speed of sound (m/s)
        air_density: Air density (kg/m³)
        f_mass: Mass break frequency (Hz) for HF roll-off. If None, no HF roll-off applied.
        Quc: Mechanical + absorption losses (default 7.0)
            - Quc = 2-5: Filled box (heavy damping)
            - Quc = 5-10: Unfilled box (mechanical losses only)
            - Quc = ∞: No losses (theoretical)
        use_complex_tf: Use complex transfer function approach (default False for backward compatibility)
            - False: Apply HF roll-off as dB post-correction (legacy)
            - True: Multiply complex transfer functions H_total = H_box × H_le × H_mass

    Returns:
        SPL in dB at measurement_distance

    Raises:
        ValueError: If frequency <= 0, Vb <= 0, or invalid driver

        >>> spl = calculate_spl_from_transfer_function(100, driver, Vb=0.010)
        >>> spl  # SPL at 1m for 10L sealed box (no HF roll-off)
        68.5...  # dB

        >>> # With HF roll-off using complex transfer functions (recommended)
        >>> spl = calculate_spl_from_transfer_function(10000, driver, Vb=0.010, f_mass=450, use_complex_tf=True)
        >>> spl  # SPL at 10kHz with HF roll-off
        70.2...  # dB

    Validation:
        Compare with Hornresp sealed box simulation.

        After efficiency fix (η = η₀, not η₀/(1+α)):
        Expected: SPL within ±0.5 dB of Hornresp for frequencies > Fc when f_mass is set.
        Previous errors of +2 to +8 dB at resonance should be eliminated.

        BC_8NDL51 validation expected:
        - Resonance (50-100 Hz): Error should be <1 dB (was +8.55 dB)
        - Midrange (150-200 Hz): Error should be <0.5 dB (was +2.15 dB)
        - High frequencies: Error determined by f_mass calibration

        Note: Calibration offset may need adjustment after efficiency fix.
        Current offset = 0.0 dB (reset from -25.25 dB).

    vectorization. It uses the complex transfer function approach for high-frequency
    roll-off, which properly models electromechanical coupling.

    Literature:

        - Small (1972), Eq. 9 - Parallel Q combination

    Transfer Function Approach:
        H_total(s) = H_box(s) × H_le(s) × H_mass(s)

        where:
        - H_box(s) = (s²/ωc²) / [s²/ωc² + s/(Qtc'·ωc) + 1] (2nd-order high-pass)
        - H_le(s) = 1 / (1 + jωτ) where τ = Le/Re (voice coil inductance)
        - H_mass(s) = 1 / (1 + j(f/f_mass)) (mass roll-off)

    Args:
        frequencies: Array of frequencies in Hz (numpy array or list)
        driver: ThieleSmallParameters instance
        Vb: Box volume (m³)
        voltage: Input voltage (V), default 2.83V (1W into 8Ω)
        measurement_distance: SPL measurement distance (m), default 1m
        speed_of_sound: Speed of sound (m/s)
        air_density: Air density (kg/m³)
        f_mass: Mass break frequency (Hz) for HF roll-off. If None, no HF roll-off applied.
        Quc: Mechanical + absorption losses (default 7.0)

    Returns:
        numpy array of SPL values in dB at measurement_distance

    Raises:
        ValueError: If Vb <= 0, or invalid driver
        ImportError: If numpy is not available

    Examples:
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> from viberesp.driver import load_driver
        >>> driver = load_driver("BC_8NDL51")
        >>> freqs = np.logspace(1, 4, 100)  # 10 Hz to 10 kHz
        >>> spl = calculate_spl_array(freqs, driver, Vb=0.010, f_mass=450)
        >>> spl.shape
        (100,)
        >>> spl[50]  # SPL at some frequency
        85.2...  # dB

    Validation:
        Compare with Hornresp sealed box simulation.

        After efficiency fix (η = η₀, not η₀/(1+α)):
        Expected: SPL within ±0.5 dB of Hornresp for frequencies > Fc when f_mass is set.
        Previous errors of +2 to +8 dB at resonance should be eliminated.

        BC_8NDL51 validation expected:
        - Resonance (50-100 Hz): Error should be <1 dB (was +8.55 dB)
        - Midrange (150-200 Hz): Error should be <0.5 dB (was +2.15 dB)
        - High frequencies: Error determined by f_mass calibration

        Note: Calibration offset may need adjustment after efficiency fix.
        Current offset = 0.0 dB (reset from -25.25 dB).

    Notes:
        - Requires numpy to be installed
        - Uses complex transfer function multiplication for accurate HF roll-off
        - Much faster than looping through individual frequencies
        - Recommended for plotting and optimization applications

    Calculate electrical impedance and SPL for sealed box enclosure.

    Literature:
        - Small (1972) - Closed-box electrical impedance, Eq. 9 for parallel Q
        - Beranek (1954), Eq. 5.20 - Radiation impedance (front side only)
        - literature/thiele_small/small_1972_closed_box.md
        - literature/horns/beranek_1954.md

    IMPORTANT NOTE ON Hornresp VALIDATION LIMITATION:
        Hornresp does NOT support QL/Quc parameter for sealed box enclosures.
        QL is only available in Hornresp for ported boxes.

        This means our sealed box Quc implementation CANNOT be directly validated
        against Hornresp. The implementation is based on Small (1972) theory:
        - Small (1972), Eq. 9: Parallel Q combination (well-established)
        - R_box formula is empirical (not from Small 1972)

        For validation, we rely on:
        1. Small (1972) theoretical foundation
        2. Physical reasoning (mechanical losses affect system damping)
        3. Consistency with ported box QL implementation (where Hornresp validation IS possible)

        If you need to match Hornresp sealed box behavior exactly, use Quc=float('inf')
        which gives the lossless case that Hornresp assumes for sealed boxes.

    Key differences from infinite baffle:
        - System resonance: Fc = Fs × √(1 + α) where α = Vas/Vb
        - Mechanical stiffness: Box compliance in series with driver suspension
        - Effective compliance: C_mb = C_ms / (1 + α) (stiffer spring)
        - Radiation mass: FRONT SIDE ONLY (1× M_rad, not 2×)
        - Total moving mass: M_ms = M_md + 1×M_rad (not 2×M_rad)

    SPL Calculation Method:
        By default (use_transfer_function_spl=True), SPL is calculated using
        Small's transfer function approach, which correctly models the frequency
        response for all drivers including high-BL designs. The transfer function
        is a 2nd-order high-pass filter that directly gives the normalized pressure
        response vs frequency.

        For legacy compatibility or comparison, set use_transfer_function_spl=False
        to use the impedance coupling method (may show SPL rise at high frequencies
        for high-BL drivers).
