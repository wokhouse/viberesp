    Calculate the voice coil inductance corner frequency.

    Above this frequency, the response rolls off at 6 dB/octave
    due to the voice coil inductance.

    Voice coil inductance is frequency-dependent (semi-inductance).
    The effective inductance decreases at higher frequencies:
    Le(f) = Le_DC × (f/1000)^(-n) where n ≈ 0.5-0.7

    This means the corner frequency increases at higher frequencies:

    Calculate high-frequency roll-off in dB for direct radiators.

    For direct radiators (sealed/ported boxes):
