Ported box SPL calculation using vector summation with correct port phase.

This module implements the ported box frequency response using the vector
summation of driver and port volume velocities, with the critical fix that
the port is driven by the REAR of the driver (-Ud), not the front (+Ud).

- Beranek (1954), "Acoustics", Chapter 8 - Rear radiation sign convention
- Thiele (1971), "Loudspeakers in Vented Boxes", Parts 1 & 2

Key Physics:
    The port is driven by the rear wave of the driver, which emits -Ud
    into the box (opposite phase to the front radiation). This creates
    the proper phase relationship:
    - Below Fb: Port reinforces driver (constructive interference)
    - Above Fb: Port cancels driver (destructive interference)

    Without the negative sign, the phase relationship is inverted,
    causing monotonic HF rise instead of proper peak-rolloff behavior.

    Calculate SPL using vector summation with correct port phase.

    This implementation uses the vector summation of driver and port volume
    velocities, with the critical fix that the port is driven by -Ud (rear
    wave), not +Ud.

    Literature:

    Key Fix:
        Up = -Ud * (Z_box / Z_box_branch)

        The negative sign accounts for the fact that the port is driven by
        the rear of the driver, which emits -Ud into the box.
