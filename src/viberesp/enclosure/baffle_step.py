Baffle step diffraction calculations.

When a driver radiates from a finite baffle, the sound transitions from
full-space radiation (4π steradians) at low frequencies to half-space
radiation (2π steradians) at high frequencies.

PHYSICS REALITY:
- Low frequencies (< f_step): Radiates into 4π space, -6 dB relative to 2π
- High frequencies (> f_step): Radiates into 2π space, 0 dB reference

This means a speaker on a baffle is LESS efficient at low frequencies
(the sound "wraps around" the baffle), NOT more efficient at high frequencies.

COMPENSATION CIRCUIT:
To flatten the response, a shelf filter boosts low frequencies by +6 dB.
This creates a flat acoustic output when combined with the baffle physics.

- Olson (1951) - Direct Radiator Loudspeaker Enclosures, JAES 2(4)
- Linkwitz (2003) - Diffraction from baffle edges, LinkwitzLab
- Stenzel (1930) - Circular baffle diffraction theory

Key equations:
- f_step ≈ 115 / width  (empirical transition frequency approximation)
- Maximum step: 6 dB (4π to 2π transition)
