Objective functions for enclosure optimization.

This module provides functions for evaluating enclosure performance across
multiple objectives:
- F3: -3dB cutoff frequency (minimize)
- Flatness: Frequency response variation (minimize)
- Efficiency: SPL output (maximize)
- Size: Enclosure volume (minimize)

All objective functions cite relevant literature and include validation
information for comparison with Hornresp.
