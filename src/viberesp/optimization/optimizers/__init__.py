"""
Multi-objective optimization algorithms.

This module provides optimization algorithms using pymoo:
- NSGA-II: Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II
- NSGA-III: For many-objective problems (>3 objectives)

Algorithms are configured for enclosure design problems with mixed
continuous and discrete parameters.
