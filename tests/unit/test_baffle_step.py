"""
Unit tests for baffle step diffraction calculations.

These tests verify the correct implementation of baffle step physics
based on Olson (1951) and Linkwitz (2003) literature.

The baffle step phenomenon describes how a speaker on a finite baffle
transitions from 4π space radiation (full space, -6 dB) at low frequencies
to 2π space radiation (half space, 0 dB) at high frequencies.
