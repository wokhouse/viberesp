MULTI-OBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION WITH TARGET BAND
======================================================================

Target band: 500 - 5000 Hz
Objectives: wavefront_sphericity, impedance_smoothness, flatness
Population: 60, Generations: 40
Pareto-optimal designs: 60

======================================================================
BEST DESIGNS
======================================================================

1. Best Flatness (in target band):
   Flatness: 2.60 dB
   Wavefront: 1.747648
   Impedance: 3.0617
   Fc: 2031 Hz

   Quality: ✓ EXCELLENT

KEY FINDINGS
======================================================================

1. Multi-objective WITH target band achieves:
   Flatness: 2.60 dB
   Wavefront: 1.747648
   Impedance: 3.0617

2. Comparison with previous results:
   Multi-obj (no target): 16.19 dB flatness
   Single-obj (flatness): 13.01 dB flatness
   Target band (single): 2.57 dB flatness
   Multi-obj (WITH target): 2.60 dB flatness

3. Improvement: 6.2× better than multi-objective without target band
