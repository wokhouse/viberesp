## Driver Specifications

**TC2 Compression Driver** (from `src/viberesp/driver/test_drivers.py`)
- Sd = 8.0 cm² (diaphragm area)
- Mmd = 8.0 g (driver mass only)
- Cms = 5.00E-05 m/N (compliance)
- Rms = 3.0 N·s/m (mechanical resistance)
- Re = 6.5 Ω (voice coil resistance)
- Le = 0.1 mH (voice coil inductance)
- BL = 12.0 T·m (force factor)
- Fs ≈ 251 Hz (resonance frequency)

## Optimization Details

### Objectives
- **Response Flatness**: Minimize SPL variation in target frequency band
- **Enclosure Size**: Minimize horn volume

### Constraints
- Mouth size limits (for practical construction)
- Flare constant limits (maintain exponential profile)
- Target frequency band (user-specified optimization range)

### Algorithm
- NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II)
- Population: 20 individuals
- Generations: 10

## Validation

All designs were validated against Hornresp to ensure:
1. Accurate frequency response predictions
2. Proper horn impedance calculations
3. Correct cutoff frequency behavior
