"""
Baffle step validation against Hornresp reference data.

This test validates the Olson/Stenzel circular baffle model against
Hornresp's baffle diffraction simulation.

Hornresp Setup Required:
------------------------
To create the reference data for this test:

1. Open Hornresp
2. Load BC_8NDL51 driver parameters (or use manual input with values from datasheet)
3. Select "Direct Radiator" as enclosure type
4. Specify baffle dimensions:
   - Baffle width: 30 cm (0.3 m)
   - Baffle height: 30 cm (0.3 m)
   - This creates a square baffle with f_step ≈ 115/0.3 ≈ 383 Hz
5. Set frequency range: 10 Hz to 10 kHz
6. Run simulation and export results to sim.txt
7. Place sim.txt in tests/validation/drivers/bc_8ndl51/finite_baffle/

Expected Results:
-----------------
The Olson model should match Hornresp within ±2 dB for:
- Overall step shape (-6 to 0 dB transition)
- Ripple frequencies in the transition region
- Magnitude of diffraction ripples

Note: Small differences are expected due to:
- Different diffraction models (circular vs rectangular)
- Hornresp may use more complex edge diffraction
- Numerical approximations in both tools

Literature:
- Olson (1951) - Direct Radiator Loudspeaker Enclosures, JAES 2(4)
- Stenzel (1930) - Circular baffle diffraction theory
- Hornresp User Manual - Baffle diffraction modeling
