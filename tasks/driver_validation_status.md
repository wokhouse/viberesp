## I_active Force Model

**Implemented**: December 26, 2025
**Commit**: 1e9abc8
**File**: `src/viberesp/driver/response.py` (lines 212-269)

### Theory
The Lorentz force on the voice coil is `F = BL × i(t)`. For time-averaged acoustic power, only the in-phase component of current contributes:

```
I_active = |I| × cos(phase(I))
F_active = BL × I_active
```

At high frequencies, voice coil inductance causes current to lag voltage by ~90°, making `I_active << |I|`. Reactive current is stored in the magnetic field but doesn't do net work.

### Literature Support
- **COMSOL (2020)**, Eq. 4: `P_E = 0.5·Re{V₀·i_c*}`
- **Kolbrek**: "Purely reactive (no real part = no power transmission)"
- **Beranek (1954)**: Only resistive component of radiation impedance radiates power

### Results
- 81% improvement at 20 kHz (26.5 dB → 5.0 dB error)
- 76% improvement at 10 kHz (20.4 dB → 4.9 dB error)
- Low-frequency accuracy maintained (<5 dB error below 500 Hz)

## Next Steps

### Analysis Required

**Immediate Investigation Needed**:
1. **Root cause analysis**: Investigate why larger drivers (bc_12ndl76, bc_18pzw100) show significantly larger Ze magnitude errors (77-93%) compared to bc_8ndl51 (32%)
2. **Low-frequency SPL**: Investigate SPL errors at very low frequencies (10-30 Hz) for large cone drivers
3. **Driver parameter correlation**: Analyze correlation between driver parameters (S_d, BL, M_ms) and validation errors

**Potential Issues to Investigate**:
- Radiation impedance model accuracy for large pistons (S_d > 500 cm²)
- Mechanical impedance calculation with high BL values
- Low-frequency asymptotic behavior in radiation impedance
- Voice coil inductance effects at resonance

**Questions to Answer**:
- Are the tolerances (35%, 90°, 6 dB) appropriate for all driver types?
- Should tolerances be scaled based on driver parameters?
- Is there a bug in the simulation that only manifests with certain parameter combinations?

### Future Enhancements
1. **Advanced voice coil models**: Implement Leach (2002) lossy inductance model
2. **Additional enclosure types**: Bass reflex, horn-loaded enclosures
3. **Directivity patterns**: Validate polar response simulations
4. **Power handling**: Validate thermal and displacement limits

## Research Agent Validation Report (2025-12-26)

### Executive Summary

An independent research agent verified the theoretical foundations of the radiation mass implementation. **Key finding**: The literature citations and mathematical formulations are correctly grounded in established acoustic theory.

### Theoretical Validation: ✅ PASSED

| Aspect | Status | Confidence |
|--------|--------|------------|
| Radiation impedance formulas | ✅ Verified | High |
| 2× multiplier justification | ✅ Theoretically sound | High |
| Low-frequency asymptote | ✅ Verified | High |
| I_active model basis | ✅ Supported by COMSOL | Medium |
| Driver parameters | ✅ Match datasheets | High |

### Key Findings

**1. Radiation Impedance Formulas Verified**
- All formulas correctly cited from Aarts & Janssen (JASA 2003) and Beranek (1954)
- Struve function formulation confirmed: `X₁(2ka) = H₁(2ka) / (ka)`
- Low-frequency asymptote verified: `X₁ ≈ 8ka/(3π)`

**2. 2× Radiation Mass Multiplier Justified**
The research agent confirmed that the 2× multiplier is **theoretically justified** for infinite baffle:
- Single side (free air): `M_rad = (8/3)·ρ₀·a³`
- Infinite baffle (both sides): `M_rad = 2 × (8/3)·ρ₀·a³ = (16/3)·ρ₀·a³`

This matches the physics: in an infinite baffle, the piston radiates into half-space on **both** the front and rear sides, each contributing equal radiation mass loading.

**3. Mmd Clarification**

The research agent noted that datasheets typically provide **Mms** (with air load), not **Mmd** (driver mass only). Our M_md values are calculated as:

```
M_md = M_ms - 2 × M_rad
```

This is correct - we input driver mass only, and radiation mass is calculated internally using Beranek theory.

**4. I_active Force Model Supported**

The COMSOL documentation confirms the electric input power formula:
```
P_E = 0.5 · Re{V₀ · i_c*}
```

This supports the I_active model where only the in-phase component of current contributes to radiated acoustic power. Reactive power circulates but does not perform work.

### Potential Issues Identified

**1. Voice Coil Model Limitations**
The "simple" voice coil model (`Z_vc = R_e + jωL_e`) does not account for:
- Eddy current losses in the voice coil former
- Frequency-dependent inductance
- Lossy inductance effects above ~1 kHz

**Recommendation**: Implement Leach (2002) lossy voice coil model for improved high-frequency accuracy.

**2. Large Driver SPL Failures**

Based on the research agent's analysis, SPL errors for large drivers may be related to:
- Cone breakup modes not modeled
- Non-uniform piston velocity at higher frequencies
- Radiation impedance approximations breaking down for large ka values

**3. Code-Level Assessment Not Possible**

The research agent could not access local project files, so code-level validation could not be performed. The assessment is based on theoretical verification only.

### Merge Recommendation

**Status**: CONDITIONAL ✅

Based on theoretical verification:
- ✅ Radiation mass implementation is theoretically sound
- ✅ 2× multiplier is justified for infinite baffle
- ✅ Literature citations are accurate
- ⚠️ SPL validation failures remain (3/4 drivers)
- ⚠️ Code implementation not independently reviewed

**Confidence Level**: 75% (limited by inability to access code files)

### Next Steps

**Priority 1**: Accept merge for radiation mass implementation (theoretical foundation verified)

**Priority 2**: Investigate SPL validation failures
- Analyze frequency-dependent error patterns
- Consider Leach (2002) voice coil model
- Investigate cone breakup modeling

**Priority 3**: Complete code review
- Verify actual implementation matches theory
- Review unit test coverage
- Check documentation compliance
