## What Was Fixed

### Bug 1: Wrong F12 Formula (CRITICAL)

**Old code:**
```python
flare_constant = (1.0 / l12_m) * math.log(s2_cm2 / s1_cm2)
fc_hz = 343.0 * flare_constant / (2.0 * math.pi)  # Olson formula (2π)
```

**Problem:**
- Used Olson's formula with 2π instead of Hornresp's 4π
- Mixed units (length in meters, areas in cm²)
- Result: F12 = 50.29 Hz (2× too high!)

**Fixed code:**
```python
# Use consistent units (cm)
l12_cm = horn.length * 100.0
flare_constant = (1.0 / l12_cm) * math.log(s2_cm2 / s1_cm2)

# Hornresp formula: F12 = c * m / (4π)
c_cm_per_s = 34300.0  # Speed of sound in cm/s
f12_hz = c_cm_per_s * flare_constant / (4.0 * math.pi)
```

**Result:** F12 = 25.15 Hz (matches Hornresp's 25.23 Hz within rounding) ✓

---

### Bug 2: Missing L12 Parameter (CRITICAL)

**Old format:**
```
S1 = 86.38
S2 = 1002.44
Exp = 50.00
F12 = 50.29
S2 = 0.00
S3 = 0.00
L23 = 0.00      ← Wrong! Should be L12
AT = 2.66       ← Wrong! This is length, not area
```

**Problem:**
- L12 (horn length in cm) was completely missing
- Hard-coded AT = 2.66 (was length in meters, not area in cm²)

**Fixed format:**
```
S1 = 86.38
S2 = 1002.44
Exp = 50.00
F12 = 25.15
S2 = 0.00
S3 = 0.00
L12 = 266.00   ← Added! Horn length in cm
S3 = 0.00
S4 = 0.00
L34 = 0.00
F34 = 0.00
S4 = 0.00
S5 = 0.00
L45 = 0.00
F45 = 0.00
AT = 86.38     ← Fixed! Throat area in cm²
```

### Bug 3: Wrong Vtc Unit Conversion

**Old behavior:**
- Function expected `V_tc_liters` in liters
- Multiplied by 1000: `Vtc = {V_tc_liters * 1000}`
- But design script passed: `V_tc_liters = params["V_tc"] * 1000` (already multiplied!)
- Result: Vtc = 19.82 (should be 19820)

**Problem:** Double conversion confusion

**Fixed:**
- Function correctly expects `V_tc_liters` in liters
- Design script passes: `V_tc_liters = params["V_tc"] * 1000` (m³ → L)
- Export multiplies by 1000: `Vtc = {V_tc_liters * 1000}` (L → cm³)
- Result: Vtc = 19820.00 cm³ ✓

**Your manual entry was CORRECT!** Vtc = 19820 cm³

## Validation Verification

### F12 Calculation

**Given:**
- S1 = 86.38 cm²
- S2 = 1002.44 cm²
- L12 = 266 cm (2.66 m)

**Flare constant:**
```
m = (1/L12) × ln(S2/S1)
m = (1/266) × ln(1002.44/86.38)
m = 0.00376 × 2.451
m = 0.00921 cm⁻¹ = 0.921 m⁻¹
```

**Hornresp F12:**
```
F12 = c × m / (4π)
F12 = 34300 × 0.00921 / (4π)
F12 = 316 / 12.566
F12 = 25.15 Hz
```

✓ **Matches Hornresp's 25.23 Hz** (rounding difference)

**✓ ALL PARAMETERS NOW MATCH!**

Your manual entry was **correct all along**. The viberesp export function had bugs.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Import corrected file to Hornresp:**
   ```
   File → Import → exports/bc15ds115_bass_horn_CORRECTED.txt
   ```

2. **Run simulation** and compare with viberesp predictions

3. **Expected agreement:** <2% deviation for impedance and frequency response

4. **Document results** in validation report

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **GitHub discussions are authoritative** - issue #21 had the correct units
2. **User's manual entry was correct** - the export function was broken
3. **Always round-trip test** - export → import → compare
4. **Hornresp uses non-obvious units:**
   - AT = throat area in cm² (NOT length!)
   - Vtc = throat chamber in cm³ (NOT liters!)
   - L12 = horn length in cm (NOT meters!)
   - F12 = c·m/(4π) (NOT 2π like Olson)

2. **`tasks/hornresp_parameter_units_correction.md`** - Detailed bug analysis
3. **`src/viberesp/hornresp/export.py`** - Fixed export function (committed to repo)
