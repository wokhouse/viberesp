## Analysis of Deviations

### Why BC_15PS100 Shows Larger Deviation

1. **Voice Coil Inductance Effects**
   - Viberesp uses simple jωL model
   - Hornresp uses Leach (2002) lossy inductance model
   - Difference becomes significant above 200Hz

2. **Driver Size Effects**
   - 15" driver has different high-frequency characteristics
   - Transfer function accuracy decreases at higher frequencies
   - Large cone break-in and suspension effects

3. **Low-Frequency Stiffness**
   - -3.2 dB deviation at 20Hz suggests box damping modeling
   - Hornresp includes proprietary loss models
   - Standard Small (1972) theory may not capture all losses

### Why BC_8NDL51 Performs Better

1. **Smaller driver (8")**
   - Less voice coil inductance effect
   - More consistent with transfer function assumptions

2. **Well-behaved parameters**
   - Moderate BL product
   - Standard Thiele-Small parameters
   - Matches textbook assumptions

## Practical Implications

### For Bass Optimization (< 200Hz)

✅ **Calibration is excellent**
- Average offset: ~±1 dB
- Frequency response shape correct
- Suitable for enclosure optimization

### For Full-Range Response (20-500Hz)

⚠️ **Calibration is acceptable with caveats**
- Excellent average performance
- Larger deviations at frequency extremes
- High-frequency deviations expected due to inductance modeling

### For High-Frequency Accuracy (> 300Hz)

❌ **Not recommended for critical applications**
- Voice coil inductance effects dominate
- Consider using impedance coupling method with Leach model
- Or use external measurement data

---

## Recommendations

### Current Calibration (✅ ACCEPTED)

The current calibration of **-25.25 dB** is **ACCEPTED** for use in the following scenarios:

1. ✅ **Enclosure optimization** (primary use case)
2. ✅ **Bass response comparison** (< 200Hz)
3. ✅ **Relative performance analysis** between designs
4. ⚠️ **Full-range response** (with awareness of limitations)
5. ❌ **High-frequency critical applications** (> 300Hz)

### Future Improvements

To improve high-frequency accuracy:

1. **Add Leach inductance model**
   - Implement lossy inductance model
   - Calibrate K and n parameters
   - Apply to both sealed and ported boxes

2. **Investigate box damping**
   - Research Hornresp's proprietary loss models
   - Add frequency-dependent damping if needed
   - Document any empirical corrections

3. **Ported box validation**
   - Currently using sealed box calibration for ported boxes
   - Validate against ported box Hornresp data when available
   - May need separate calibration constant

4. **High-BL driver investigation**
   - BC_15PS100 has high BL (21.3 T·m)
   - Check if transfer function assumptions hold
   - May need driver-specific corrections
