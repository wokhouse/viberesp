Fix the SPL calculation bug by removing double-counting of mechanical impedance.

Research from online agent identified that we're using Small's transfer function
which includes motional impedance in Ze, then dividing by Zm again.

Correct equation: v = (BL × V) / (Ze_electrical × Zm + BL²)

where Ze_electrical = Re + jωLe (NO motional component)
