**Status**: Ready for Research Agent
**Branch**: feature/infinite-baffle-validation-fix

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive research plan for validating the recent work on:
1. **Radiation mass implementation** (Beranek 1954, Eq. 5.20)
2. **Iterative resonance solver** matching Hornresp's 2× radiation mass methodology
3. **I_active force model** for SPL calculations

## Part 1: Literature Citation Validation

### Task 1.1: Verify Beranek (1954) Citation Accuracy

**Objective**: Ensure the radiation mass implementation correctly cites and implements Beranek's equations.

**Research Steps**:
1. Read `literature/horns/beranek_1954.md`
2. Locate Equation 5.20 for radiation impedance
3. Verify the reactance formula: `Z_R = ρc·S·[R₁(2ka) + jX₁(2ka)]`
4. Confirm the Struve function formulation: `X₁(2ka) = H₁(2ka) / (ka)`
5. Check that the low-frequency asymptote `X₁ ≈ 8ka/(3π)` is correct

**Deliverable**:
- Report confirming or flagging discrepancies in:
  - Equation numbering
  - Mathematical formulations
  - Variable definitions
  - Units used

## Part 2: Mathematical Derivation Verification

### Task 2.1: Verify Radiation Mass Derivation

**Objective**: Ensure the mathematical derivation from radiation reactance to equivalent mass is correct.

**Research Steps**:
1. Start from Beranek Eq. 5.20: `X_rad = ρc·S·X₁(2ka)`
2. Verify the mass conversion: `M_rad = X_rad / ω`
3. Confirm the low-frequency limit: `M_rad ≈ (16/3)·ρ₀·a³`
4. Check numerical stability handling for `ka < 0.01`
5. Verify the 2× radiation mass multiplier rationale

**Key Questions**:
