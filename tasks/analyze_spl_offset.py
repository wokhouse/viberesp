Analyze the SPL offset between transfer function and impedance coupling methods.

This script helps identify the calibration offset needed by comparing the
transfer function approach (which has correct shape but wrong absolute level)
against the impedance coupling approach (which may have shape issues but
can be closer to correct level).
