# Task: Investigate High-Frequency SPL Roll-off Discrepancy

## Context

During validation of the BC 8NDL51 infinite baffle simulation, we discovered a significant discrepancy in high-frequency SPL predictions between viberesp and Hornresp:

### Observed Issue
- **Low frequencies (<500 Hz)**: Excellent agreement (<2 dB error)
- **High frequencies (>5 kHz)**: Large errors (15-26 dB)

Specifically:
| Frequency | Hornresp SPL | Viberesp SPL | Error |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|-------|
| 500 Hz    | 92.8 dB      | 94.2 dB      | 1.4 dB |
| 2 kHz     | 84.6 dB      | 90.8 dB      | 6.2 dB |
| 5 kHz     | 69.6 dB      | 84.3 dB     | 14.7 dB |
| 10 kHz    | 58.1 dB      | 78.6 dB     | 20.5 dB |
| 20 kHz    | 46.2 dB      | 72.7 dB     | 26.5 dB |

Hornresp shows **-47 dB roll-off** from 500 Hz to 20 kHz, while viberesp shows only **-21 dB roll-off**.

### Known Working Areas
1. **Driver parameters**: Perfect match (Mms, Cms, BL, Re, Le all identical)
2. **Electrical impedance**: Excellent match at all frequencies with simple model
3. **Low-frequency SPL**: Excellent agreement (<2 dB error below 500 Hz)
4. **Resonance**: Peak impedance matches within 6%

## Investigation Goals

Identify why viberesp's SPL calculation doesn't roll off at high frequencies like Hornresp does.

## Investigation Steps

### 1. Verify Hornresp Configuration

**File**: `tests/validation/drivers/bc_8ndl51/infinite_baffle/BC_8NDL51_input.txt`

Check:
- Line 38: `Le = 0.500` (traditional inductance model)
- Line 46: `Le = 0.00` (semi-inductance disabled)
- Line 151: `Lossy Inductance Model Flag = 0` (lossy model OFF)
- Line 152: `Semi-Inductance Model Flag = 0` (semi-inductance OFF)

**Confirm**: Hornresp is using simple voice coil model (jωL inductor only)

### 2. Analyze SPL Calculation in Viberesp

**File**: `src/viberesp/driver/response.py`

**Location**: Lines 240-263 (SPL calculation)

**Current formula**:
```python
pressure_amplitude = (omega * air_density * abs(volume_velocity)) / (2 * math.pi * measurement_distance)
```

**Questions to investigate**:
1. Is this formula correct for all frequencies?
2. Should there be frequency-dependent directivity effects?
3. Is the volume velocity calculation correct at high frequencies?
4. Are there missing terms for high-frequency behavior?

### 3. Check Volume Velocity Calculation

The volume velocity `u_diaphragm * S_d` depends on the diaphragm velocity, which is calculated from the electrical circuit model.

**Investigate**:
- How is `u_diaphragm` calculated in `electrical_impedance.py`?
- Does the motional impedance model correctly capture high-frequency behavior?
- Is there a frequency-dependent mass loading effect?

**Key equation**: The force on the diaphragm is `F = BL * i`, and the velocity depends on the mechanical impedance:
```
u_diaphragm = (BL * i) / Z_mechanical
```

where `Z_mechanical = R_ms + j(ω*M_ms - 1/(ω*C_ms)) + Z_radiation`

### 4. Investigate Radiation Impedance Effects

**File**: `src/viberesp/driver/radiation_impedance.py`

**Current implementation**: Circular piston in infinite baffle (Beranek 1954)

**Check**:
- Does radiation impedance properly affect the mechanical system at high frequencies?
- The radiation resistance `R₁(ka)` approaches 1.0 at high frequencies (ka >> 1)
- The radiation reactance `X₁(ka)` approaches 0 at high frequencies

**Calculate ka for BC 8NDL51**:
- Piston radius: a = √(S_d/π) = √(0.0220/π) = 83.7 mm
- At 20 kHz: ka = 2π × 20000 × 0.0837 / 343 = 30.6 >> 1 (high-frequency regime)

**Question**: At high frequencies, does the radiation impedance properly load the mechanical system?

### 5. Check for Missing Physics

**Possible missing effects**:

1. **Voice coil inductance on current**:
   - High inductive reactance at high frequencies
   - Reduces current through the coil: `I = V / |Z_e|`
   - At 20 kHz: `Z_e ≈ jωL = j×2π×20000×0.0005 = j63 Ω`
   - This should reduce current and SPL

2. **Mass roll-off**:
   - At very high frequencies, the diaphragm mass dominates
   - Acceleration `a = F/m` decreases with frequency
   - SPL should roll off at -12 dB/octave for mass-controlled radiation

3. **Cone break-up modes**:
   - Real drivers have resonances in the mid-high frequency range
   - These can cause additional roll-off
   - Hornresp may model these; viberesp currently does not

4. **Inductance parameter effects**:
   - Even with Le = 0.5 mH, the inductance affects current
   - Check if this is properly included in the electrical impedance calculation

### 6. Compare Intermediate Calculations

Create a diagnostic script to compare:

```python
# At key frequencies (100 Hz, 1 kHz, 5 kHz, 10 kHz, 20 kHz)
for f in [100, 1000, 5000, 10000, 20000]:
    # Calculate and print:
    # 1. Electrical impedance Ze
    # 2. Current I = V / Ze
    # 3. Force F = BL * I
    # 4. Mechanical impedance Z_mech
    # 5. Diaphragm velocity u = F / Z_mech
    # 6. Volume velocity U = u * S_d
    # 7. Radiation impedance Z_rad
    # 8. Pressure p = f(U, Z_rad)
    # 9. SPL
```

This will show which step is causing the divergence.

### 7. Check Hornresp Documentation

**File**: Search for Hornresp documentation or theory

Look for:
- How does Hornresp calculate SPL at high frequencies?
- Are there additional terms in the SPL formula?
- Does Hornresp include inductance effects in the SPL calculation?

### 8. Test Hypotheses

**Hypothesis 1**: Missing inductance effect on SPL calculation
- **Test**: Manually calculate expected SPL reduction due to inductance
- **Expected**: At 20 kHz, current should be `I = 2.83V / 63Ω ≈ 45 mA` (vs 533 mA at DC)
- **Check**: Does viberesp show this current reduction?

**Hypothesis 2**: Incorrect mechanical impedance calculation
- **Test**: Verify that mechanical impedance increases correctly with frequency
- **Expected**: `Z_mechanical ≈ ω*M_ms` at high frequencies (mass-controlled)
- **Check**: Does this dominate the calculation?

**Hypothesis 3**: Radiation impedance not properly affecting system
- **Test**: Calculate radiation impedance at high frequencies
- **Expected**: `Z_rad ≈ ρc*S_d` (real value, no reactance)
- **Check**: Is this added to mechanical impedance correctly?

## Expected Deliverables

1. **Diagnostic script** showing intermediate calculations at multiple frequencies
2. **Root cause identification** explaining the SPL roll-off difference
3. **Proposed fix** with code changes if applicable
4. **Updated validation** showing improved agreement with Hornresp
5. **Documentation** of any limitations or assumptions

## Success Criteria

- High-frequency SPL error reduced to <5 dB at 10 kHz and <10 dB at 20 kHz
- Understanding of why Hornresp shows faster roll-off
- Code fix or explanation of fundamental modeling difference
- Updated validation tests with appropriate frequency ranges

## Notes

- The electrical impedance matches perfectly, so the voice coil inductance IS being modeled correctly
- The issue is specifically in how this translates to SPL
- Focus on the chain: Voltage → Current → Force → Velocity → Volume Velocity → Pressure → SPL
- One link in this chain must be incorrect or incomplete at high frequencies

## Resources

- Driver parameters: `tests/validation/drivers/bc_8ndl51/infinite_baffle/BC_8NDL51_input.txt`
- Hornresp results: `tests/validation/drivers/bc_8ndl51/infinite_baffle/8ndl51_sim.txt`

## Major Discovery: Root Cause Identified (2025-12-26)

### Current Analysis - Phase 1 Complete

**Extracted Hornresp Iin values and compared with viberesp:**

| Freq | Hornresp Iin | Viberesp |I| | Ratio | Hornresp SPL | Viberesp SPL | Error |
|------|--------------|---------------|-------|--------------|--------------|-------|
| 100 Hz | 0.187 A | 0.196 A | 0.96 | 88.3 dB | 87.8 dB | -0.4 dB |
| 1 kHz | 0.484 A | 0.448 A | 1.08 | 91.2 dB | 92.6 dB | +1.5 dB |
| 10 kHz | 0.089 A | 0.089 A | 1.00 | 58.1 dB | 78.6 dB | +20.5 dB |
| 20 kHz | 0.045 A | 0.045 A | 1.00 | 46.2 dB | 72.7 dB | +26.5 dB |

**KEY FINDING: Current magnitudes MATCH PERFECTLY at high frequencies!** (ratio ≈ 1.00)

This means:
1. ✅ Voice coil inductance is correctly modeled in viberesp
2. ✅ Electrical impedance calculation is correct
3. ✅ Current calculation is correct
4. ❌ **The problem is NOT in the electrical domain**

### Mechanical Impedance Analysis - Phase 1.5 Complete

**Reverse-engineered Hornresp mechanical impedance from SPL values:**

| Freq | Viberesp Z_mech | Hornresp Z_mech | Ratio (HR/Vib) |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| 100 Hz | 12.8 Ω_mech | 11.6 Ω_mech | 0.91× |
| 1 kHz | 168.0 Ω_mech | 214.7 Ω_mech | 1.28× |
| 2 kHz | 336.6 Ω_mech | 685.1 Ω_mech | 2.04× |
| 5 kHz | 841.9 Ω_mech | 4543.8 Ω_mech | 5.40× |
| 10 kHz | 1683.9 Ω_mech | 17726.0 Ω_mech | **10.53×** |
| 20 kHz | 3367.8 Ω_mech | ~71300 Ω_mech | **21.2×** |

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY:**

The mechanical impedance ratio (Hornresp/Viberesp) **perfectly matches** the volume velocity ratio:

At 20 kHz:
- Volume velocity ratio: U_viberesp / U_HR = 21.2× (= 26.5 dB)
- Mechanical impedance ratio: Z_mech_HR / Z_mech_vib = 21.2×

This is EXACTLY what we expect from `u = F/Z_mech` when force is the same!

### What's Working Correctly

1. **Current calculation**: Perfect match at all frequencies
2. **Force calculation**: Should be F = BL × I (same for both since BL and I match)
3. **Radiation impedance**: Correctly calculated (varies properly with frequency)
4. **Low-frequency behavior**: Excellent agreement (<2 dB below 500 Hz)

### The Mystery

**Why does Hornresp have 21.2× higher mechanical impedance at 20 kHz?**

The mechanical impedance formula is:
```
Z_mechanical = Z_mech_driver + Z_acoustic_reflected
             = (R_ms + jωM_ms + 1/jωC_ms) + (Z_rad × S_d²)
```

At 20 kHz:
- Z_mech_driver ≈ 3368 Ω_mech (dominated by mass: jωM_ms)
- Z_acoustic_reflected ≈ 0.004 Ω_mech (negligible!)
- Z_mechanical_total ≈ 3368 Ω_mech

But Hornresp has Z_mech ≈ 71300 Ω_mech, which is **21.2× higher**!

### Possible Explanations

1. **Hornresp uses different force calculation**
   - Viberesp: F = BL × |I| (current magnitude)
   - Hornresp: F = BL × I_active (only in-phase component)
   - At 20 kHz: I = 45 mA ∠ -85°, I_active = 45 × cos(-85°) = 3.9 mA
   - Force ratio: 45/3.9 = 11.5× (not quite 21×, but in the right direction)

2. **Hornresp includes additional high-frequency losses**
   - Voice coil inductance effects on force (not just current)
   - Frequency-dependent BL reduction
   - Additional mechanical resistance at high frequencies
   - Cone break-up modes

3. **Hornresp uses different equivalent circuit topology**
   - Series vs parallel placement of voice coil inductance
   - Different impedance transformation ratio

4. **Hornresp's impedance calculation includes something we're missing**
   - Semi-inductance effects (even though flag is 0)
   - Lossy inductance model effects
   - Frequency-dependent parameters

### Next Investigation Steps

**Priority 1**: Test the active current hypothesis ✅ COMPLETED
- Calculate SPL using F = BL × I_active instead of F = BL × |I|
- See if this matches Hornresp's SPL values

**Priority 2**: Literature review on energy conservation
- Does reactive current contribute to force in electromechanical transducers?
- When should we use I_active vs |I| for force calculation?
- Check COMSOL (2020) and Small (1972) for guidance

**Priority 3**: Contact Hornresp author or search documentation
- How does Hornresp calculate force from current?
- Are there any undocumented corrections at high frequencies?

## Active Current Hypothesis Test Results (2025-12-26)

### Test: I_active vs I_mag Force Models

**Hypothesis**: Hornresp uses F = BL × I_active (energy-conserving model) instead of F = BL × |I| (magnitude-based model).

**Results:**

| Freq | Hornresp SPL | I_mag SPL (Error) | I_active SPL (Error) | Current Phase |
|------|--------------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| 100 Hz | 88.26 dB | 87.84 dB (-0.42 dB) | 83.74 dB (-4.52 dB) | 51.44° |
| 500 Hz | 92.81 dB | 93.19 dB (+0.38 dB) | 93.18 dB (+0.37 dB) | 2.58° |
| 1 kHz | 91.18 dB | 92.64 dB (+1.46 dB) | 92.06 dB (+0.88 dB) | -20.63° |
| 2 kHz | 84.55 dB | 90.26 dB (+5.71 dB) | 87.31 dB (+2.76 dB) | -44.62° |
| 5 kHz | 69.64 dB | 84.23 dB (+14.59 dB) | 75.24 dB (+5.60 dB) | -69.19° |
| 10 kHz | 58.15 dB | 78.57 dB (+20.42 dB) | 63.92 dB (+5.77 dB) | -79.33° |
| 20 kHz | 46.15 dB | 72.64 dB (+26.49 dB) | 52.06 dB (+5.91 dB) | -84.63° |

**KEY FINDINGS:**

1. **I_active model is MUCH closer to Hornresp at high frequencies**
   - At 20 kHz: Error reduced from **26.5 dB to only 5.9 dB** (78% improvement!)
   - At 10 kHz: Error reduced from **20.4 dB to 5.8 dB** (72% improvement!)
   - At 5 kHz: Error reduced from **14.6 dB to 5.6 dB** (62% improvement!)

2. **I_active model slightly worsens low-frequency performance**
   - At 100 Hz: Error increases from -0.42 dB to -4.52 dB
   - This is because at resonance, current and voltage are ~90° out of phase due to mechanical resonance, not inductance
   - The I_active model doesn't account for this distinction

3. **Remaining 5-6 dB error at high frequencies**
   - The I_active model still has a consistent +5-6 dB error above 2 kHz
   - Possible explanations:
     - Hornresp uses a hybrid model: `I_eff = sqrt(I_active² + (k × I_reactive)²)` with k ≈ 0.5-0.7
     - Additional high-frequency losses (cone break-up, BL reduction, etc.)
     - Frequency-dependent mechanical resistance
     - Undocumented Hornresp corrections

### Physical Interpretation

**Why I_active makes sense:**

In an electromechanical transducer:
- **Complex power**: S = V × I* = P + jQ
  - P = V × I × cos(θ) = real/active power (does work)
  - Q = V × I × sin(θ) = reactive power (stored in magnetic field)

- **At high frequencies (20 kHz)**:
  - Current lags voltage by ~85° due to voice coil inductance
  - Most current is REACTIVE (stored in magnetic field, not doing work)
  - Only the in-phase (active) component contributes to mechanical force

- **Force equation**:
  - Traditional model: F = BL × |I| (uses magnitude)
  - Energy-conserving model: F = BL × I_active (uses only active component)
  - At 20 kHz: I_active = |I| × cos(-85°) = 0.05 × |I| (20× smaller!)

**This explains why viberesp overestimates high-frequency SPL by 26.5 dB!**

## Final Conclusions and Recommendations (2025-12-26)

### Root Cause Identified

**Viberesp uses F = BL × |I| (current magnitude), while Hornresp appears to use F = BL × I_active (active component only).**

This difference explains **78% of the 26.5 dB discrepancy** at 20 kHz.

### Why This Matters

At low frequencies (<500 Hz):
- Current and voltage are nearly in phase (θ ≈ 0°)
- I_active ≈ |I|
- Both models give similar results
- Excellent agreement (<2 dB error)

At high frequencies (>2 kHz):
- Voice coil inductance causes current to lag voltage by ~70-85°
- I_active = |I| × cos(θ) << |I|
- I_active is 5-20× smaller than |I|
- Viberesp overestimates force and SPL by 20-26 dB

### Hornresp's Additional Corrections

The remaining 5-6 dB error suggests Hornresp uses:
1. A hybrid model combining I_active and partial I_reactive
2. OR additional high-frequency effects not captured by simple I_active model
3. OR frequency-dependent BL factor
4. OR additional mechanical resistance at high frequencies

### Recommendations

#### Option 1: Implement I_active Model (Recommended)

**Pros:**
- Reduces high-frequency error from 26.5 dB to 5.9 dB (78% improvement)
- Based on sound physics (energy conservation)
- Matches Hornresp much more closely across full frequency range
- Simple to implement

**Cons:**
- Worsens low-frequency performance slightly (can be addressed with frequency-dependent model)
- Still has 5-6 dB residual error at high frequencies
- Need to find literature citations for energy-conserving force model

**Implementation:**
```python
# In src/viberesp/driver/response.py

# Calculate complex current
I_complex = voltage / Ze

# Extract active component (in phase with voltage)
# At high frequencies, only this contributes to mechanical work
I_phase = cmath.phase(I_complex)
I_active = abs(I_complex) * math.cos(I_phase)

# Use active current for force calculation
F = driver.BL * I_active  # Instead of F = driver.BL * abs(I_complex)
```

**Validation:**
- Test against multiple drivers (not just BC 8NDL51)
- Compare with Hornresp for various enclosure types
- Verify low-frequency performance is not significantly degraded

#### Option 2: Document the Difference (Alternative)

If the I_active model cannot be adequately justified from literature:

**Document in `literature/modeling_differences/hornresp_force_calculation.md`:**

1. **Problem**: 26.5 dB high-frequency SPL discrepancy
2. **Root cause**: Different force calculation models
   - Viberesp: F = BL × |I| (standard Thiele-Small model)
   - Hornresp: F = BL × I_active (energy-conserving, undocumented)
3. **Frequency ranges**:
   - <500 Hz: Both models agree within 2 dB
   - 500 Hz - 2 kHz: Difference of 2-6 dB
   - >2 kHz: Difference of 14-26 dB
4. **Recommendations**:
   - Use viberesp for low-frequency design (<500 Hz)
   - Use Hornresp for full-range validation
   - Future work: Implement energy-conserving model with literature support

#### Option 3: Hybrid Approach

Implement a frequency-dependent model:
- Below 500 Hz: Use I_mag (current Thiele-Small model)
- Above 2 kHz: Use I_active (energy-conserving model)
- Transition region: Blend between models

**Pros:**
- Best of both approaches
- Excellent agreement at all frequencies
- Minimizes low-frequency degradation

**Cons:**
- More complex implementation
- Ad-hoc approach without clear theoretical justification
- Harder to validate against literature

### Success Criteria

**Investigation Status**: ✅ **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**

- ✅ Current magnitudes match perfectly between viberesp and Hornresp
- ✅ Mechanical impedance ratio matches volume velocity ratio (as expected from u = F/Z)
- ✅ Identified that force calculation is the issue (I_mag vs I_active)
- ✅ I_active model explains 78% of the discrepancy
- ⚠️ Remaining 5-6 dB unexplained (likely Hornresp-specific corrections)

**Next Steps**:
1. Literature review on energy conservation in electromechanical transducers
2. Implement I_active model if literature support is found
3. OR document the modeling difference with clear frequency range limitations
4. Update validation tests with appropriate tolerances

## Initial Diagnostic Results (2025-12-26)

Ran diagnostic script `tasks/diagnose_spl_rolloff.py` with key findings:

### ✅ What's Working
1. **Electrical impedance**: Perfect match at all frequencies (0% error at 20 kHz)
2. **Voice coil inductance**: Correctly modeled (jωL)
3. **Current calculation**: Correctly decreases with frequency
   - 100 Hz: 170.8 mA
   - 500 Hz: 522.5 mA (peak)
   - 20 kHz: 44.9 mA
4. **Mechanical impedance**: Correctly increases with frequency (mass-controlled)
5. **Volume velocity**: Correctly decreases
   - 500 Hz: 1625 cm³/s
   - 20 kHz: 3.6 cm³/s
6. **SPL calculation**: Physics appear correct based on standard formulas

### 🚨 Problem Identified
**Consistent 25-26 dB offset at high frequencies** (above 2 kHz):

| Freq | Hornresp SPL | Viberesp SPL | Difference |
|------|--------------|--------------|------------|
| 2 kHz  | 84.5 dB | 90.7 dB | +6.1 dB |
| 5 kHz  | 69.6 dB | 84.3 dB | +14.7 dB |
| 10 kHz | 58.1 dB | 78.6 dB | +20.5 dB |
| 20 kHz | 46.2 dB | 72.7 dB | +26.5 dB |

**This is NOT a gradual divergence - it's a consistent modeling difference that increases with frequency.**

### 🔍 Most Likely Causes (in order of probability)

1. **Different SPL calculation formula**
   - Viberesp uses: `p = (ω × ρ₀ × U) / (2πr)` (on-axis monopole)
   - Hornresp may use: Different directivity pattern or piston formula
   - **Check**: Beranek (1954) for circular piston directivity

2. **Hornresp includes frequency-dependent efficiency correction**
   - Real drivers become less efficient at high frequencies
   - Cone break-up, inductance losses, etc.
   - **Check**: Hornresp documentation for efficiency model

3. **Measurement distance or reference difference**
   - Viberesp calculates at 1m
   - Hornresp might use different reference
   - **Check**: Verify measurement distance is same

4. **Missing radiation impedance directivity term**
   - On-axis pressure should include directivity function
   - For circular piston: `D(θ) = 2·J₁(ka·sinθ) / (ka·sinθ)`
   - On-axis (θ=0): D(0) = 1, so this shouldn't matter

### 📋 Next Investigation Steps

1. **Verify SPL formula in literature**
   - Check Kinsler et al. (1982) for piston radiation
   - Check Beranek (1954) Chapter 5
   - Formula might be missing directivity or efficiency terms

2. **Calculate expected SPL from Hornresp's volume velocity**
   - Reverse-engineer: What U value would give Hornresp's SPL?
   - At 20 kHz: Hornresp SPL = 46.2 dB
   - This implies: `p = 20e-6 × 10^(46.2/20) = 3.62e-3 Pa`
   - Required U for this p: `U = (2πr × p) / (ω × ρ₀) = (2π × 1 × 3.62e-3) / (2π × 20000 × 1.18) = 1.53e-7 m³/s = 0.153 cm³/s`
   - Compare to viberesp U: 3.639 cm³/s
   - **Hornresp's volume velocity is 23.8× LOWER than viberesp's at 20 kHz!**

3. **Critical finding**: Hornresp must be calculating a MUCH lower volume velocity than viberesp
   - This suggests the mechanical system modeling is different
   - Possible causes:
     - Additional mechanical resistance/damping at high frequencies
     - Force reduction due to inductance (not fully captured)
     - Different motional impedance calculation

4. **Check force calculation**: F = BL × I
   - At 20 kHz: I = 44.9 mA, BL = 12.39 T·m → F = 0.557 N
   - This seems correct
   - But Hornresp might have additional force reduction factors

5. **Hypothesis**: Hornresp's motional impedance (BL²/Z_mech) is calculated differently
   - Or there's an additional impedance term we're missing
   - **Action**: Compare Z_mech calculation with Hornresp theory
