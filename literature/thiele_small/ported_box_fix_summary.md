# Ported Box Fixes - Summary of Changes

## Date: 2025-12-27

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Efficiency Formula (FIXED ✓)
**Location:** `src/viberesp/enclosure/ported_box.py:669`

**Before (BROKEN):**
```python
eta_0 = (air_density / (2 * math.pi * speed_of_sound)) * \
        ((4 * math.pi ** 2 * driver.F_s ** 3 * driver.V_as) / driver.Q_es)
```
Result: η₀ = 3122 (312,255% - IMPOSSIBLE!)

**After (CORRECT):**
```python
# Small (1973), Eq. 25
K_ETA = (4 * math.pi ** 2) / (speed_of_sound ** 3)  # ≈ 9.64e-7 s³/m³
eta_0 = K_ETA * (driver.F_s ** 3 * driver.V_as) / driver.Q_es
```
Result: η₀ = 0.141 (14.1% - reasonable for high-BL driver)

### 2. Transfer Function Numerator (FIXED ✓)
**Location:** `src/viberesp/enclosure/ported_box.py:638`

**Before (BROKEN):**
```python
numerator_port = (s ** 2) * (Tb ** 2) + s * (Tb / Qp) + 1
```
Result: Wrong frequency dependence, rolled off at high frequencies

**After (CORRECT):**
```python
# Small (1973), Eq. 13: N(s) = s⁴·T_B²·T_S²
numerator = (s ** 4) * a4  # where a4 = Tb² × Ts²
```
Result: Transfer function correctly approaches 1 (0 dB) at high frequencies

### 3. SPL Response Uses Qts (FIXED ✓)
**Location:** `src/viberesp/enclosure/ported_box.py:622`

**Change:** SPL denominator now uses `Qt = driver.Q_ts` instead of `driver.Q_es`

**Rationale:** Small (1973) uses Q_T (total Q) for SPL response, Q_ES (electrical Q) only for impedance.

### 4. Calibration Updated (PARTIAL FIX)
**Location:** `src/viberesp/enclosure/ported_box.py:708`

**New calibration:** -8.2 dB (calibrated at 500 Hz)

**Note:** This calibration works at 500 Hz but will have errors at other frequencies due to missing mass-controlled roll-off.

## Validation Results (BC_15DS115 B4 Alignment)

### Before Fixes
- Mean error: -3.84 dB
- Max error: ±22.9 dB
- Std deviation: 10.50 dB
- Transfer function broken: -39.69 dB at 200 Hz (should be ~0 dB)
- Status: ❌ FAILED

### After Fixes
- Mean error: -15.50 dB (calibrated at 500 Hz)
- Max error: -25.8 dB (at 30 Hz peak)
- Std deviation: 2.98 dB (much better!)
- Transfer function working: approaches 0 dB at high frequencies ✓
- At 500 Hz: matches Hornresp (88.2 dB) ✓
- Status: ⚠️ PARTIAL - Calibration point correct, but errors elsewhere

## Remaining Limitations

### 1. Mass-Controlled Roll-off Not Implemented
**Issue:** Small's transfer function only models the vented-box 4th-order high-pass response. It does NOT include the driver's mass-controlled roll-off at high frequencies.

**Evidence:**
- At 5 kHz: Viberesp predicts ~91 dB (flat), Hornresp shows 59.2 dB (rolled off)
- Our transfer function approaches 0 dB (-0.05 dB at 5 kHz)
- Hornresp includes mass roll-off (1st-order low-pass)

**Impact:** Calibration at 500 Hz gives correct result there, but errors occur at frequencies where the transfer function deviates from its calibration point.

**Fix needed:** Add mass-controlled roll-off term to transfer function:
```
G_total(s) = G_vented_box(s) × G_mass_roll_off(s)
```

where `G_mass_roll_off(s)` is a 1st-order low-pass related to driver mass and voice coil inductance.

### 2. Impedance Model Still Issues
**Issue:** `ported_box_impedance_small()` doesn't work for extreme drivers (Qes < 0.1, BL > 30 T·m)

**Current behavior:** Flat ~150 Ω across frequency

**Expected:** Dual-peak pattern matching Hornresp

**Workaround:** Use `impedance_model="circuit"` for impedance calculations

### 3. Peak at Fb Not Captured Correctly
**Issue:** At 30 Hz (near Fb=33 Hz), Hornresp shows peak of 103 dB, our model shows 77 dB (-26 dB error)

**Possible cause:** Transfer function coefficients may need adjustment for extreme Qts values

## Recommendations

### Immediate
1. Document current calibration is valid at 500 Hz only
2. Add warning for extreme drivers (Qes < 0.1, BL > 30 T·m)
3. Use circuit model for impedance on extreme drivers

### Short-term
1. Implement mass-controlled roll-off in transfer function
2. Recalibrate to high-frequency asymptote (where TF → 0 dB)
3. Validate against multiple drivers with different Qts values

### Long-term
1. Investigate why Small's impedance model fails for extreme drivers
2. Consider alternative formulations (normalized vs unnormalized)
3. Add comprehensive validation suite for various driver types
