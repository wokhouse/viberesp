## Key Concepts

### Voice Coil Inductance Model

Traditional loudspeaker models treat the voice coil inductance as a pure inductor:
```
Z_L(jω) = jωL_e
```

However, real voice coils exhibit **eddy current losses** at high frequencies that cause the inductor to behave more like a resistor. Leach (2002) proposes a **lossy inductor model**:

```
Z_L(jω) = K·(jω)^n
```

Where:
- **K**: Impedance scaling factor (Ω·s^n)
- **n**: Loss exponent (0 ≤ n ≤ 1)
  - n = 1: Lossless inductor (pure inductance, no losses)
  - n = 0: Pure resistor (no inductance, maximum losses)
  - n = 0.6-0.7: Typical values for voice coils

### Physical Interpretation

The lossy inductor can be represented as a **frequency-dependent resistor and inductor in series**:

```
R_s(ω) = K·ω^n·cos(nπ/2)  (Series resistance)
L_s(ω) = K·ω^(n-1)·sin(nπ/2)  (Series inductance)
```

At low frequencies (n → 1), the model approaches a pure inductor.
At high frequencies (n → 0), the model approaches a pure resistor.

### Eddy Current Losses

Eddy currents are induced in:
1. Voice coil former (typically aluminum or kapton)
2. Pole piece and front plate of the magnetic circuit
3. Voice coil windings themselves

These losses increase with frequency and cause the voice coil impedance to flatten at high frequencies rather than continue rising linearly.

## Equations

### Voice Coil Impedance (Leach Model)

**Equation 19** from Leach (2002):
```
Z_vc(jω) = R_e + K·(jω)^n
```

Where:
```
Z_vc(jω) = R_e + K·ω^n [cos(nπ/2) + j·sin(nπ/2)]
```

### Component Form

The complex impedance can be separated into real and imaginary parts:

**Resistance component:**
```
Re{Z_vc} = R_e + K·ω^n·cos(nπ/2)
```

**Reactance component:**
```
Im{Z_vc} = K·ω^n·sin(nπ/2)
```

### Series Equivalent Circuit

The lossy inductor can be represented as a frequency-dependent R-L series circuit:

```
R_s(ω) = K·ω^n·cos(nπ/2)
L_s(ω) = K·ω^(n-1)·sin(nπ/2)
```

## Parameter Extraction

### Method 1: Curve Fitting

Fit the model to measured impedance data using least-squares optimization:

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import curve_fit

def leach_model(omega, K, n, R_e):
    """Leach lossy inductor model"""
    return R_e + K * (omega ** n) * (np.cos(n * np.pi / 2) + 1j * np.sin(n * np.pi / 2))

# Fit to measured data
omega_meas = 2 * np.pi * f_meas  # Angular frequency
Z_meas = R_meas + 1j * X_meas  # Measured impedance

popt, _ = curve_fit(
    lambda w, K, n: leach_model(w, K, n, R_e),
    omega_meas,
    Z_meas,
    p0=[2.0, 0.5]  # Initial guess: K=2.0, n=0.5
)

K_fit, n_fit = popt
```

### Method 2: High-Frequency Limit

At very high frequencies (ω → ∞), if n → 0, then:
```
|Z_vc| → R_e + K
```

So K can be estimated from:
```
K ≈ |Z_vc(ω_high)| - R_e
```

### Method 3: Phase Angle Method

At any frequency:
```
tan(θ) = Im{Z_vc} / Re{Z_vc} = tan(nπ/2)
```

So the loss exponent can be estimated from the phase angle:
```
n = (2/π)·arctan(Im{Z_vc} / (Re{Z_vc} - R_e))
```

## Practical Implementation

### Frequency-Limited Model

For most loudspeakers:
- **Low frequencies (<500 Hz)**: Simple jωL_e model is sufficient
- **High frequencies (>1 kHz)**: Leach model required for accuracy

**Recommended implementation:**
```python
def voice_coil_impedance(frequency, driver, K, n, crossover_hz=1000):
    """Frequency-limited Leach model"""
    omega = 2 * np.pi * frequency

    if frequency < crossover_hz:
        # Low frequency: simple jωL model
        return driver.R_e + 1j * omega * driver.L_e
    else:
        # High frequency: Leach lossy inductor model
        Z_lossy = K * (omega ** n) * complex(
            np.cos(n * np.pi / 2),
            np.sin(n * np.pi / 2)
        )
        return driver.R_e + Z_lossy
```

### Parameter Values for Common Drivers

| Driver | K (Ω·s^n) | n | Notes |
|--------|----------|---|-------|
| BC 8NDL51 | 2.02 | 0.03 | Nearly resistive at HF |
| BC 12NDL76 | ~2.5 | ~0.1 | Estimated |
| Generic 8" | 1.5-3.0 | 0.0-0.3 | Typical range |

**Note:** Parameters should be fitted to actual impedance measurements or validated against Hornresp data.

## Comparison with Simple Model

### Simple jωL_e Model (Traditional)

```
Z_vc = R_e + jωL_e
```

**Advantages:**
- Simple, analytical
- Easy to understand
- Accurate at low frequencies

**Disadvantages:**
- Overestimates impedance at high frequencies
- Cannot account for eddy current losses
- Leads to errors >500% at 20 kHz for some drivers

### Leach Lossy Inductor Model

```
Z_vc = R_e + K·(jω)^n
```

**Advantages:**
- Matches measured impedance at all frequencies
- Accounts for eddy current losses
- Reduces high-frequency error from >500% to <5%

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires additional parameters (K, n)
- More complex math
- Parameters must be fitted to data

## Validation Results

### BC 8NDL51 Driver (Fitted Parameters)

**Parameters:** K = 2.02 Ω·s^n, n = 0.03

**High-frequency validation (>1 kHz):**
- 20 kHz: |Z| = 8.17 Ω (Leach) vs 8.00 Ω (Hornresp) → **2.1% error**
- 2 kHz: |Z| = 7.98 Ω (Leach) vs 7.85 Ω (Hornresp) → **1.7% error**
- Max error (1-20 kHz): **4.3%** at 1.4 kHz

**Compare with simple model:**
- 20 kHz: |Z| = 63.04 Ω (simple) vs 8.00 Ω (Hornresp) → **688% error**

**Conclusion:** Leach model reduces high-frequency error from 688% to 4.3%.

## Limitations

1. **Parameter dependence**: K and n vary with driver design
   - Shorting rings reduce n (more resistive)
   - Copper caps reduce K (less additional impedance)
   - Large voice coils have higher n (more inductive)

2. **Temperature effects**: Voice coil resistance R_e increases with temperature
   - Leach model assumes constant R_e
   - For power handling analysis, include thermal modeling

3. **Frequency range**: Model is valid above ~50 Hz
   - Below 50 Hz, simple jωL_e model is sufficient
   - Very high frequencies (>20 kHz) may need additional corrections

## Applications

### Loudspeaker Simulation
- Accurate high-frequency impedance prediction
- Power response calculations
- Crossover design

### Hornresp Integration
Hornresp uses a similar "lossy inductance" model with adjustable parameters:
- "Lossy Le" setting in driver parameters
- Semi-inductance model flag
- Can be matched to Leach (2002) parameters

### Filter Design
- Accurate impedance modeling for crossover networks
- Predicts impedance rise at high frequencies
- Enables better zobel network design
