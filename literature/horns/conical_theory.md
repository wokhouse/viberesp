# Conical Horn Theory

## Overview

The conical horn is the simplest horn geometry, consisting of a straight-sided cone. Unlike exponential horns, it expands linearly in radius and quadratically in area. It supports spherical wavefronts rather than the plane waves assumed in Webster's equation.

## Geometry

### Area Function

The area expansion for a conical horn is:

$$S(x) = S_t \left(1 + \frac{x}{x_0}\right)^2$$

Where:
- $S_t$ is the throat area
- $x$ is the axial distance from the throat
- $x_0$ is the distance from the projected apex of the cone to the throat

Alternatively, if defining by throat radius $r_t$ and mouth radius $r_m$ over length $L$:

$$r(x) = r_t + \frac{r_m - r_t}{L}x$$

$$S(x) = \pi r(x)^2$$

The two forms are geometrically equivalent.

### Calculating x0

From similar triangles relating the throat and mouth radii:

$$\frac{r_t}{x_0} = \frac{r_m - r_t}{L}$$

Therefore:

$$x_0 = \frac{r_t \cdot L}{r_m - r_t}$$

This can also be expressed in terms of areas:

$$x_0 = \frac{L \sqrt{S_t}}{\sqrt{S_m} - \sqrt{S_t}}$$

## Acoustic Impedance

### Infinite Conical Horn

The throat impedance of an infinite conical horn is derived from spherical wave theory:

$$Z_t = \frac{\rho c}{S_t} \left[ \frac{j k x_0}{1 + j k x_0} \right]$$

Where:
- $\rho$ = air density (~1.21 kg/m³)
- $c$ = speed of sound (~343 m/s)
- $k$ = wavenumber ($\omega/c$ or $2\pi f/c$)
- $x_0$ = distance from apex to throat

**Real and Imaginary Components:**

Separating into resistance $R_t$ and reactance $X_t$ where $Z_t = R_t + jX_t$:

$$R_t = \frac{\rho c}{S_t} \cdot \frac{k^2 x_0^2}{1 + k^2 x_0^2}$$

$$X_t = \frac{\rho c}{S_t} \cdot \frac{k x_0}{1 + k^2 x_0^2}$$

- Beranek (1954), p. 270 - Spherical wave impedance derivation

### Finite Conical Horns

For finite conical horns, the impedance must be calculated using the transmission matrix (T-Matrix) method or by transforming the mouth load impedance back to the throat. The infinite horn formula above provides the theoretical ideal behavior for validation.

## Cutoff Frequency Behavior

### Crucial Distinction from Exponential Horns

Conical horns **do not have a distinct cutoff frequency** in the same way exponential horns do.

| Horn Type | Cutoff Behavior |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Exponential** | Sharp cutoff at $f_C = mc/4\pi$. Below this, resistance drops to zero. |
| **Conical** | No sharp cutoff. Resistance rises gradually from zero frequency. |

**Literature:**
- Pierce (1981) - Notes that applying Webster's equation to cones reveals no cutoff frequency
- Post (1994) - Discussion of cutoff frequency in conical waveguides

### Implications

1. **No frequency below which propagation stops** - Conical horns can propagate at all frequencies, but efficiency is poor at low frequencies due to the small $x_0$.

2. **Smoother impedance curve** - The resistance rises smoothly rather than showing a sharp step at cutoff.

3. **Wider bandwidth** - Conical horns can maintain reasonable loading over a wider frequency range compared to exponential horns, though with less optimal loading at any specific frequency.

4. **Constant directivity potential** - The linear expansion provides more constant directivity characteristics compared to exponential horns.

## Comparison with Exponential Horns

| Feature | Exponential / Hyperbolic | Conical |
|:--------|:-------------------------|:---------|
| **Wavefront** | Planar (Webster's equation) | Spherical |
| **Area Expansion** | $S_t e^{mx}$ | $S_t (1 + x/x_0)^2$ |
| **Impedance** | High ripple, sharp cutoff | Low ripple, no sharp cutoff |
| **Bandwidth** | Limited (high freq distortion) | Wide (constant directivity potential) |
| **Distortion** | Higher (throat constriction) | Lower |
| **Cutoff** | Yes, sharp cutoff frequency | No distinct cutoff |

## Implementation Notes

### Hornresp Convention

Hornresp defines conical horns using:
- S1 (Throat area)
- S2 (Mouth area)
- L12 (Length)

The x0 parameter is then derived from these three inputs using the formula above.

### Numerical Considerations

1. **Small x0** - When the flare angle is large (small x0), the impedance becomes highly frequency-dependent and reactive.

2. **Large x0** - As x0 → ∞ (cylinder), the impedance approaches that of a cylindrical pipe.

3. **Finite vs Infinite** - Real horns are finite and require T-matrix simulation. The infinite formula is primarily for validation and understanding.

### Validation Approach

To validate conical horn implementation:

1. **Geometry Check**: Verify area calculation at various points
   - At throat (x=0): S(0) = S_t
   - At mouth (x=L): S(L) = S_m
   - At midpoint (x=L/2): Verify against geometric mean of radii

2. **Impedance Check**: Compare infinite horn impedance with theory
   - Low frequency (k*x0 << 1): Mostly reactive, mass-like
   - High frequency (k*x0 >> 1): Approaches ρc/S_t

3. **Hornresp Comparison**:
   - Export conical horn parameters to Hornresp
   - Compare throat impedance curves
   - Resistance should rise smoothly (no sharp cutoff step)

## Implementation Validation (2025-12-30)

### Explicit ABCD Formulas Using Wronskian

The conical horn T-matrix implementation uses explicit formulas derived from the Wronskian identity for spherical Bessel functions, providing better numerical stability than direct matrix inversion.

**T-Matrix Elements (explicit form):**

Let a = kr₁ (throat), b = kr₂ (mouth), where r₁ = x₀, r₂ = x₀ + L.

Define cross-products:
- A₀₀ = j₀(a)y₁(b) - y₀(a)j₁(b)
- A₀₁ = j₀(a)y₀(b) - y₀(a)j₀(b)
- A₁₁ = j₁(a)y₁(b) - y₁(a)j₁(b)
- A₁₀ = j₀(b)y₁(a) - j₁(a)y₀(b)

Then the T-matrix elements are:
```
A = -(kr₂)² · A₀₀
B = (jρc/S_m)(kr₂)² · A₀₁
C = -(S_t/jρc)(kr₂)² · A₁₁
D = -(kr₂)² · (S_t/S_m) · A₁₀
```

**Derivation:**
The state matrix M(r) for spherical waves is:
```
M(r) = [[j₀(kr), y₀(kr)],
        [(S/jρc)j₁(kr), (S/jρc)y₁(kr)]]
```

The T-matrix is T = M(r₁) · M(r₂)⁻¹. Using the explicit inverse formula:
```
det(M(r₂)) = (S_m/jρc)[j₀(kr₂)y₁(kr₂) - j₁(kr₂)y₀(kr₂)]
            = (S_m/jρc)(-(kr₂)⁻²)  [by Wronskian]
```

This leads to the explicit formulas above, which avoid numerical singularities at low frequencies.

## Hornresp Validation Results (2025-12-30)

### Test Configuration

Used Hornresp simulation files from `imports/` directory:
- **Case 1**: S1=150cm², S2=1500cm², L12=120cm (Con=120), BC 8NDL51 driver
- **Case 2**: S1=200cm², S2=800cm², L12=50cm (Con=50), BC 8NDL51 driver

Note: In Hornresp parameter format, `Con = 120` means **conical horn** with L12 = 120cm, NOT a flare constant.

### Validation Results

**Case 1 (10:1 expansion, 120cm length):**
- Za deviation: Max 0.00%, Mean 0.00% ✅
- Ra deviation: Max 0.48%, Mean 0.02% ✅
- Xa deviation: Max 0.22%, Mean 0.00% ✅
- **Status: ✓ PASS (< 2% tolerance)**

**Case 2 (4:1 expansion, 50cm length):**
- Za deviation: Max 0.00%, Mean 0.00% ✅
- Ra deviation: Max 0.36%, Mean 0.01% ✅
- Xa deviation: Max 0.09%, Mean 0.00% ✅
- **Status: ✓ PASS (< 2% tolerance)**

**Overall Result: ✅ ALL TESTS PASSED**

The conical horn implementation has been validated against Hornresp with excellent agreement (< 0.5% deviation across all test cases).

### Implementation Notes

**Normalization Convention:**
Hornresp reports acoustic impedance as:
```
Za_hornresp = Z_throat / (ρc/S1) = Z_throat * S1 / (ρc)
```

This is different from the typical acoustic impedance Z_throat [Pa·s/m³]. When comparing viberesp results to Hornresp, we must normalize by (ρc/S1):

```python
Z0 = rho * c  # Characteristic impedance of medium
S1_m2 = throat_area  # Throat area in m²
Za_normalized = Z_throat * S1_m2 / Z0
```

**Validation Script:**
`tests/validation/horn_theory/conical_vs_hornresp.py` contains the complete validation code comparing viberesp conical horn throat impedance against Hornresp simulation results.
