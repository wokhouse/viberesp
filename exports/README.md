# Viberesp Exports Directory

This directory contains **Viberesp parameter output files** (Hornresp input files).

## Purpose
Temporary working directory for files generated by `viberesp export` commands.
These files are meant to be copied into Hornresp for simulation.

## Usage
```bash
# Export a driver
viberesp export BC_12NDL76 -o exports/bc_12ndl76_inf.txt

# Then copy this file to your Hornresp VM and import it
```

## Files in this directory
- Intended as a **staging area** for copy/paste operations
- **Not version controlled** (see .gitignore)
- Move completed simulations to `tests/validation/drivers/` for permanent storage

## Related Directories
- `imports/` - Hornresp simulation results
- `tests/validation/drivers/` - Permanent validation data (version controlled)
