# Viberesp Exports Directory

This directory contains **Viberesp parameter output files** (Hornresp input files).

## Directory Structure

```
exports/
├── sealed_boxes/          # Sealed box enclosure exports
│   └── BC_8NDL51/         # Sealed box configurations
└── ported_boxes/          # Ported (vented) box enclosure exports
    └── BC_8NDL51/         # Ported box configurations
```

## Purpose
Temporary working directory for files generated by `viberesp export` commands.
These files are meant to be copied into Hornresp for simulation.

## Usage
```bash
# Export a driver
viberesp export BC_12NDL76 -o exports/bc_12ndl76_inf.txt

# Then copy this file to your Hornresp VM and import it
```

## Files in this directory
- Intended as a **staging area** for copy/paste operations
- **Not version controlled** (see .gitignore)
- Move completed simulations to `tests/validation_data/` for permanent storage

## Related Directories

- `tests/validation_data/` - Permanent validation data (version controlled)
