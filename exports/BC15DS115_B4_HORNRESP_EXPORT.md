## Expected Results (from viberesp)

### Frequency Response
```
Frequency (Hz) | SPL (dB)
---------------|----------
      20       |   98.2
      30       |   93.4
      40       |   91.8
      50       |   90.2
      70       |   87.3
     100       |   84.2
     150       |   80.4
     200       |   77.7
```

### Performance Metrics
```
F3 cutoff:         ~33 Hz
Peak SPL:          ~98 dB @ 20 Hz
Bass Flatness:     σ = 2.48 dB (20-80 Hz) ⭐
Full Flatness:     σ = 4.90 dB (20-200 Hz)
```

## Validation Checklist

After importing into Hornresp, verify:

- [ ] F3 is approximately 33 Hz
- [ ] Response is flat in the bass region (20-80 Hz)
- [ ] Impedance shows double peaks at Fs and Fb
- [ ] Port velocity is acceptable (< 20 m/s at rated power)
- [ ] Diaphragm displacement is within Xmax limits

## Design Characteristics

### Advantages
✅ Maximally flat bass response (Butterworth alignment)
✅ Excellent bass extension (F3 = 33 Hz)
✅ High output in deep bass (+5 dB over small box)
✅ Classic well-understood alignment

### Trade-offs
⚠️ Large enclosure (254 L)
⚠️ More bass boost can sound "boomy" in small rooms
⚠️ Higher diaphragm excursion at low frequencies
⚠️ May require EQ for flat response above 80 Hz

## Comparison with Other Designs

| Design | Vb | Fb | Bass Flatness | Deep Bass Output |
|--------|-----|-----|---------------|------------------|
| 50L    | 50L | 35Hz| 4.58 dB      | 93 dB @ 20Hz     |
| 80L    | 80L | 33Hz| 3.41 dB      | 95 dB @ 20Hz     |
| **254L (B4)** | **254L** | **33Hz** | **2.48 dB** ⭐ | **98 dB @ 20Hz** ⭐ |

## Practical Considerations

### Box Size
254L is a **large enclosure** (about 9 cubic feet). Typical dimensions:
- 24" W × 24" H × 30" D (external with ¾" material)
- Or: 60 cm W × 60 cm H × 75 cm D

### Port Design
- **Recommended:** Slot port (easier to build)
- **Avoid:** Single 7" round port (hard to find, may resonate)
- **Minimum:** 255 cm² port area to avoid chuffing

### Power Handling
- **Continuous:** 200 W RMS (driver rated)
- **Peak:** 400 W (limited by Xmax at low frequencies)
- **Use:** High-pass filter at 25 Hz for protection
